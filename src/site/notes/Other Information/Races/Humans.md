### Overview
By far, the most common race found within [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. They can be found in most regions and, in general, were fierce and disagreeable, which could sometimes lead certain other [[Other Information/Races/Races\|races]] to view them with contempt. They were renowned for their diversity and ambition, and although they lacked specialisation, they could excel in many areas.

### Attitudes & Beliefs
Humans, especially those found in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], are known to be incredibly racist, especially against the [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]].

### History
Up until the [[History & Events/Eras/5th Era\|5th Era]], humans were slaves in the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] until [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] led a revolution to overthrow the [[Dwarfs\|Dwarfs]] and gain independence. Once the empire was overthrown, [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] was founded and became the primary settlement for humans. 

Over the years, [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] and [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] have fought in many wars against each other, with the most recent one being the [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]], which took place a little before the start of the campaign. 

Humans were the primary fighting force during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]], leading to general hatred towards the followers of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]].
