### Humanoid 
A general term for the enormous variety of sentient species that made up the world's primary inhabitants, both savage and civilized. They were capable of language, culture, and in many cases of learning magic

#### Description
Humanoids were typically bipedal, having two arms, two legs, and walking upright. But they varied widely in terms of size and features. Most did not have innate [spellcasting](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellcaster "Spellcaster") abilities (notable exceptions included the [drow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow")), and they were generally capable of using tools and weapons.

#### Sub-Families
- **Demihumans**: This was the term used to collectively refer to [[Other Information/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]], [[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]], [[Other Information/Races/Gnomes\|Gnomes]], and [[Other Information/Races/Halflings\|Halflings]] What some humans viewed as being the "civilized", generally benevolent, non-humans. The term "demihuman" was rooted in a human-centric perspective, as some [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]] considered themselves to be wholly distinct from other humanoids, some even going so far as to claim that humans predated most humanoid races.
- **Goblinoids**: Otherwise known as "goblinkin," "goblinoid" was a term used to collectively refer to [goblins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin "Goblin") and the humanoid races believed to be related to them, such as [[Orcs\|Orcs]].
- **Humanoids**: The term humanoids was also frequently used in a narrower sense, which excluded humans as well as demihumans and giants.
