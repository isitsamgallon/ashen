### Overview
Mordecai Reverence is a Tiefling who is from somewhere in the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Uvam Dynasty\|Uvam Dynasty]]. They are a Sorcerer/Bard multi-class and a member of [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Renowned for their dramatic flair and innate magical aptitude, Mordecai is often both the heart of the group's charm and a source of their tension. His aversion to fire magic and knack for theatrical improvisation have made him a standout figure in their journeys. Played by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]].

### Personality
Mord is a performer at heart, every aspect of their personality is meticulously planned to make themself as likeable and interesting as possible. He is overdramatic and led firmly by his emotions which can lead him to be inherently selfish in their decisions - though they try their best to cover it up as much as humanly possible. Mordecai craves the dramatics that life and adventure entails, forging an interesting narrative wherever they go - creating conflict or quiet moments of calmness where he believes the story of their life should have it. He tries to be good, though often impulsivity can get in the way

### Description
![MordProfilePic.jpg](/img/user/Admin/Attachments/MordProfilePic.jpg)

---
---

Mordecai Reverence is always adorned in whatever finery he has been able to afford over the years, favouring gold jewellery and royal purple fabrics that compliment his red complexion. Their long dark hair has gold threads and cuffs encircling different strands. He wears a lot of makeup, favouring the brighter colours as almost a mask to aid the persona he meticulously formed over the years. The only thing genuine about them would be his cloak, clearly old however well maintained. The colour faded to a dull brown, however each hole was meticulously stitched. Though he is clearly fiendish, his eyes are oddly human.



### Backstory Summary
Mordecai was a young child when their magic activated randomly, causing a massive fireball to launch inside of his family home. The house fire that ensued caused the death of their [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Claribelle Reverence â€ \|Mother]] and some of their siblings. It was later revealed that their father and brother survived the fire and have been hunting Mordecai down ever since. 

Sometime later they arrived in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Minatota\|Minatota]] where they joined the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] to make money, eventually catching the eye, and obsessive love, of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]]. They later broke free of their work there and soon found themselves captured by [[Groups/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]].

### Trivia
- Mordecai's mini is based on the female character model on Eldritch Foundry because the male models weren't "Twinky enough".
- Due to a series of misunderstandings, Drache ships Mordecai and Chenris - much to their dismay 
- Mordecai canonically does drag and has even put [[The Party/The Korrigan/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] and [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] in their own drag costumes at times.
