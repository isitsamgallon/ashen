### Overview
Korrigan is a human-fey hybrid and [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]. He is a Ranger/Druid Multi-class known for using a powerful lightning bow and fey-magic. He first joined [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] as [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] before he eventually died when fighting a Wyvern on the [[Locations/Verdant Spine\|Verdant Spine]] near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. He later rejoined the party in his new form with barely any of his memories, however, over time he regained most of his memories when interacting with things reminiscent of his past. He was incredibly close with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], being one of the few people able to understand him and tell when they were lying. He is played by [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Tom Brothers\|Tom Brothers]]

### Personality 
Korrigan is generally a very happy and seemingly quite innocent person who prioritises someone's freedom and the safety of nature above all else. He fiercely defends his friends and allies and just wants them to be happy. Underneath the surface, he is deeply troubled as he tries to reconcile his human life with his new life as a Fey creature and the Herald of Lorwyn.  

### Description
Korrigan looks identically to [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]], the only difference being that Korrigan has a large pair of antlers growing out the sides of his head.

### Backstory Summary
The first part of Kal's backstory hasn't been revealed publicly yet. 

After these events, Kal ran away to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], where he was soon tricked into joining the [[Groups/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] where he became their slave for over 6 years before finally breaking free with the help of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]]. After finally being free, he left The Dawn and soon found himself in [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|The Dawn]].

After his death, he awoke in Lorwyn's realm where he eventually made a deal with her that allowed him to return back to life as her Herald so he could finish his business in [[Locations/Important Locations & Nations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. In return, he must destroy one of [[Admin/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] for her own enjoyment.
