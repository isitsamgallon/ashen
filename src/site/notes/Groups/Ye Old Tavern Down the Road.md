[[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is an official sponsor! The Weatherspoon's of [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Most of [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] have Ye Old Tavern Down the Road branded cloaks. Sometimes [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] will use this to their advantage for disguises, like when [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] disguised himself as part of the Taverns team that asked people for their opinions in [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Forest\|The Black Forest]].

Ye Old Tavern Down the Road can allegedly be found in most cities and towns around [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], but here is a list of cities they were especially mentioned to be in:
- [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]
- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]] 
- [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] - The Elves know of it and see it as a low-class pub that none of them would want to go to.
