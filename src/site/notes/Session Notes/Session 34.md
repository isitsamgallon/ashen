# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
"Aiden Knight" woke up next to his wife in their home, where they lived with their two children. He quickly finished his breakfast before rushing off to work. The details of his job eluded him, but he knew it was important. He put on his heavy, worn robes and rushed out the door. As soon as he crossed the threshold, his body went into autopilot, and he found himself going about his duties at work. 

Before he knew it, it was already lunchtime. Suddenly, he heard sounds of screaming outside the building. He rushed out to find a madman laughing maniacally as he attacked his co-workers and the townsfolk.

Knowing this man had to be stopped he reached for his trusty Warhammer the he had had from when he was 20, Now at the at the age of 45 he knew exactly how to use it. If this man wasn't stopped then he could go after his family or the whole town. Gripping the Warhammer tightly, he gave aloud roar as he lunched for the mad man with a heavy swing. The madman, a younger man with light blond hair turned to him, blooded soaking his black clothes and with a cruel laugh he lifted his arm and shot him with a power blast of magic. [[The Party/Aiden Knight\|Aiden Knight]] did even hit the floor before falling to the floor dead. 

Next thing he knew, he woke up in a lush forest filled with flowers and animals unknown to him, a rogue. He took a few steps before his keen senses noticed a lady walking past behind a tree. She gave him a coy smile and invited him over. Aiden Knight instantly recognized her as a Lorwyn; her features matched exactly how The Korrigan had described her. 

Cautiously, he approached her, unsure of how to engage in conversation. She spoke first, her voice trying to sound serious but betraying itself with a playful tone. She warned him that it was not wise to take orders from a "no-good asshole."

Before he could respond, she clicked her fingers, and an image materialized in the air. The vision was hard to look at, as if it broke the very rules of reality, but it clearly depicted his hand in the destruction of the Tower of Ishnmel. He watched in horror as his body became slowly overtaken by Chronovorus, ultimately floating into the air and causing various large time rifts throughout Ishnmel. The sight was chilling, especially since he had never witnessed the destruction he caused from this perspective. 

The vision ended just as he collapsed, the last thing he saw being the Lorwyn's coy smile.

He woke up in a room with three doors and what appeared to be a grandfather clock. However, it was missing the cog, second and minute hands, and the pendulum. Suddenly, Lorwyn's voice boomed in his head, informing him that he needed to develop some mental fortitude and that she would only let him go once he retrieved all the missing parts from the clock. With nothing else to do, he walked through the first door.

Upon crossing the threshold, he found himself in a park where four children were play-fighting with sticks as swords. One of those sticks turned out to be the missing pendulum. Glancing over his shoulder, he noticed that the door he had come through had disappeared. As he approached the children, he realized that they were all younger versions of members of The Party. Mordecai Reverence held the pendulum, which they used to declare themselves the leader. The other kids were fighting among themselves, but without their magic, Halfbie and The Korrigan stood no chance against Drache, who easily won and became the leader's bodyguard.

As he moved closer, Aiden Knight stepped into a puddle and looked down, seeing that he too was a child again, scars on his face intact. The other kids noticed him, pulling his attention away from his reflection, and he asked if he could join their game.

After some argument, they finally allowed him to participate and asked him to suggest a game. Spotting the pendulum, he proposed a race for Mordecai's sword, which he thought looked really cool. They all agreed and took their positions. Halfbie shouted "GO!" and Drache launched forward, his strong legs propelling him ahead and winning the race easily. Ecstatic, Drache claimed his prize and asked what they should play next. Aiden decided they should play Hide and Seek, knowing it was a game he could win easily.

Aiden won with ease, finding Drache first, who had assumed that if he couldn't see them, they couldn't see him. Afterward, Mordecai reluctantly handed over the pendulum after knighting Aiden with it. Once it was in his hands, Aiden returned to the room with three doors but left the pendulum behind as he walked through the next door.

This time, he found himself in a house he was all too familiar with. The smell of pancakes enveloped him as he followed it to the kitchen of his family home in Whitespire. There, he discovered his parents cooking and his sister, Freya, sitting at the table, waiting for breakfast. After they finished eating, his parents were much nicer than the ones he knew. His father then asked if he could go to the shop and pick up a few things. He nodded meekly before rushing off to the nearby Halos Emporium. Inside, he found the items his father wanted, and while paying, he noticed a newspaper detailing the story of a group called The Fatebreakers. They had died in an attack by the Goblin Mafia, which had caused a large forest fire.

He soon fell asleep after returning home. In the middle of the night, he awoke to find a cloaked figure in his room. The figure held out an orb that revealed a life he never hadâ€”a life where he was happy with his family, where his parents had never joined The Black Cult. It was a chance to escape to that reality, or he could return to the real world, where he was constantly bombarded with pain and suffering. After contemplating for a long time, he resolved to stay in the reality he knew, surrounded by his friends. The figure then handed him one of the clock pieces, and he found himself back in the room with one final door to go through.
