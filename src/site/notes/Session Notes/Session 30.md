# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
Korrigan ends the connection between him and Terathra and returns to the cavern. In a slight daze, they return to face Malin, who stands to the side with his head bowed respectfully. Halfbie awkwardly asks if this is when Malin wants to do it, and if so, does he have a way he wants to go? Malin says that he doesn't really care as long as it is painless and soon, so he won't have to deal with the fiery explosions that come with Ignatious's return. Drache is confused, wondering why he would want to die now as surely he would be sent straight to Ignatius, who was bound to be furious with the priest. 

Although Ignatius is the God of Fire and Cleansing, he is also the God of Violence and War. When his soldiers and followers die, their souls get sent to Ignatius's eternal battlefield, where they fight a myriad of monsters, demons and beasts. Moderates who had given up on war go to the same place but are put in a separate area, which is covered in fire, and people are in great pain. Ignatius is the general of his army and is too busy to come to see the moderates, so it is believed that even though the existence will be painful, it will be peaceful. Halfbie whispers to Korrigan, wondering if it might be better to Kill Malin with Ice magic so he won't be as affected by the fire in the bad place. Korrigan didn't respond.

Malin carried on talking, almost losing himself in his own words of doom and gloom. He explained that During the first Sundering, the world had The Auditors, Galen Verix, and other strong warriors, like Caden SteelBreaker. Now, most of those warriors are dead and missing. The Dawn Empire is fractured, and Ehobel has lost its most powerful Wizard queen, Ashira Yelris. Strixhaven, although still a strong faction, is nowhere near the same strength as before, with its renewed focus on research during times of peace. Tulan Fort is in shambles, and the Emerald Fort is without a leader.

Looking slightly pissed off now, Drache surmises that Malin wants them to destroy the tower and then kill him so he doesn't have to deal with the fallout - Malin agrees.
Halfbie analyses the tower and notes that the crystal isn't at the centre of it like the others. Instead, the crystals line the walls and focus on the tower. Korrigan touches on them, and a husky and laboured voice whispers to him, "Light bearers." Korrigan's head snaps in the direction of the voice, and it is one of the black wraiths they saw in The Dawnhaven Crypts; Halfbie and Mordacai also recognise them from The Tower of Ishnmel. 

Halfbie asked about The Tower, noting its distinct difference from the other towers before becoming slightly confused about what the towers were. Malin explained that he was here before The Tower or Temple was built. Before the temple was around, there was nothing, just an empty plane. Then, a crystal crashed on this land, causing an enormous crater. Sometime after, A dragon appeared, and she explained she would use the crystal to ensure the Sundering wouldn't happen again. The people, still mourning the loss of their friends and family, desperately agreed. The dragon spent months and months building something that could use the crystal. Eventually, he was successful and went around the world using fragments of the crystal to build more towers all over. Malin and the other priests soon gathered around to protect it, creating a church over it to hide it from The Ashen Cult and anyone who might have bad intentions.

Korrigan asks if they do kill him, will they be hunted down for his death? Malin explains that this room is rarely used and is not known to many people. Additionally, many of the staff do not enter the different rooms dedicated to the Gods; they would not know he was dead for many weeks or even months. After Korrigan asked, he confirmed that the number of people, excluding the party, who knew of this room could be counted on one hand. 
Without a moment's hesitation, Korrigan drew his bow and shot Malin in the head. The arrow buried deep in the priest's eye, threatening to come out the other side. Malin crumpled to the floor, dead instantly. Korrigan explained to the shocked members of his party that killing him now would ensure that no one related to Ignatius would ever be able to find out about The Tower and would serve to buy them time. They admitted he had a point, but Drache and Aidan were annoyed that none were given a say.

While this happens, Halfbie analyses the crystal and determines that it can be removed carefully. He tries to do so, being as careful as possible, but he messes it up, leading to the explosion of the crystal. Drache questions them on why they're trying to do this as it seems impossible; Halfbie explains that it's possible and it could allow them to understand the towers better and give them an advantage in the war.

Korrigan suggests they both use their Misty Step abilities to move it. Both of them grab onto the crystal and activate their abilities; Korrigan teleports a few feet from the wall with one half in his hand, instantly exploding. However, Halfbie is nowhere to be found. Drache is now incredibly corned that one of their party members may be missing - especially one surrounded by so much mystery; he demands to know where Halfbie is. Korrigan began to panic, unsure where to search for their missing friend. Korrigan turned to Drache, unsure and screamed that this would normally be something [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] would be left to solve. 

Drache tried to calm him down and told him to start from the beginning and explain how their Misty Step works. After a few deep breaths, they explained that their version works slightly differently from the more common version. He functions by taking him through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s before appearing in the spot he wanted. Drache paused for a moment before suggesting that maybe their ability malfunctioned and sent Halfbie to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] with korrigan but left them there. Korrigan filed with his bow for a moment before saying that could be the case as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] would have no way out of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] and so could be trapped. A moment passed for Korrigan's eyes widened in panic as he screamed, "OH MY GOD, HALFBIE IS IN THE FEYWILD!" before teleporting there himself. He landed in his usual spot: outside a golden temple dedicated to [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He threw out his magic, searching for this friend and breathed a sigh of relief, and he sensed them moving to them slowly. 

Looking up, they saw an old man covered in dirt and crime, covered in a burlap sack that was being used as a cloak for worms. They looked malnourished and unkept as a long whisper, white beards trailed on the floor between their legs.

Halfbie opened their eyes after the teleport, only to find themselves in a dense forest that they instantly recognised as the Feywilds. They checked the crystal to see if the plan at least worked, but in the hand was what looked to be a small rift that seemed to cut the very fabric of reality. Inside, Halfbie could see an inky black void that contained thousands of tiny stars and galaxies. More importantly, there was a weird magical session that sounded like a rift. On further analysis, Halfbie realised in horror that magic was being sucked into the rift. Knowing that if too much magic was absorbed, there could be catastrophic consequences for not just the Feywilds but the universe as a whole. Their worries were soon halted when they realised that the rift was quickly closing, and after a minute, the rift had disappeared. It was as if magic was repairing the rift, and as it wasn't that significant, it was a relatively quick fix.

With the rift resolved, Halfbie turned their attention to their next problem: how they were going to leave the Feywilds. They were anxious to leave, as they were well aware of the dangers of these lands. They recognised the general area but weren't sure they knew exactly where they were. They decided to pick a direction and walk; theoretically, they should run into someone or some settlement at some point. Travelling through the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s, they managed to stay safe through clever spellwork and ingenuity, surviving on berries or whatever animals they could hunt. The animals of the Fey were strange and almost uncanny like they either should exist or some mad scientist fused what they assumed two different animals should be like as the days turned into weeks, into months and months into years. Halfbie's mind began to unravel as they walked around aimlessly in the fairest way that would not stop moving and shifting. It was as if the very ground beneath them breathed, and the trees turned to look whenever they made a sound. 

After 20 years, Halfbie had become too accustomed to this world and lost himself in the routine of hunting, forging and wandering aimlessly. However, one day, they came across a wooden hut occupied by a beautiful Autumn Eldarin. The Eldarin smiles kindly and invites them in for some food, offering a bowl of hearty chicken noodle soup. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was grateful and accepted, not caring that this would put them in debt to a fey creature. They devoured many bowls of the soup before passing out on the floor. They awoke in a comfy bed to a spell of bacon on eggs being fried up for breakfast. The Eldarin looked up from the cast iron pan and invited them to stay for breakfast. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s mind, now refreshed, gladly accepted and asked how they could repay their debt. The Eldarin initially refused any payment but eventually relented and said they would be grateful for work around the house, like cleaning and feeding the animals outside. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quickly got work as they used various magics to clean the house until even the old wooden walls looked brand new. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] collected their things and began to leave before they were stopped by the Eldarin, who grabbed their arm, offering them a bed and food for a few months in return for help around the house and other...help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], who missed their meaning, thanked them profusely but explained that they had to go, their friends were waiting for them, and they had to return soon. The Eldarin looked saddened but told them to wait a moment before returning inside quickly. He appeared again just as quickly with a large burlap sack they had fashioned soon into a cloak, expelling that it would help keep them warm at night. With a caring hand on their shoulder, the Eldarin wished them safe travel and hoped they would one day return. 

They carried on their march but soon became lost again. This time, they did not find another part of civilisation for over 700 years. They ran into many people who seemed to be stuck in the same situation as him - lost with their minds unravelling with every step they took. One day off in the distance, Halfbie spotted a large golden structure, which notably did not move. They immediately didn't trust this as they came to know that the world moving around was normal, so seeing something staying still was now a strange and foreign experience. Nonetheless, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s inquisitive mind got the better of them, and they decided to investigate. Clutching onto their stuff for support, they slowly began to make their way over. Their moments and strength had weakened in their old age, but they were determined to learn more. 

At first, they circled around the temple slowly before they spotted a horned humanoid with a large bow on their back. They moved in closer, and the figure seemed very familiar; when it clicked, this was their friend, The Kal Korrigan. They rushed over as fast as their frail body would allow them to. Strangely, as they got closer, they began to move faster and faster until they were running over to their friend. Their body seemed to age as they got closer to their old friend. Korrigan turned to them with confusion and then later shock as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] hugged their friend tight. Korrigan pulled away after a moment and asked what happened and why were they so old.
