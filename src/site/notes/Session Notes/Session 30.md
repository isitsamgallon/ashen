# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
- Come out from talking to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and the pillar and cavern in front of the party. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] is standing to the side with his head bowed. 
- [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] ask if this was when Malin wanted to die and Malin says yes and want his death to be quick as he doesn't wanna die in a fiery explosion 
- Drache says killing him would send him straight to Ignatius and he might not look favourably 
- Malin says it is the god of fire and cleansing as well as violence or war. when his soldiers die, they go to an eternal battleground where they fight monsters, demons, etc. Moderates who have given up violence go to the fire part - the bad place
- Halfbie wonders if killing him with ice damage will help him
- IG stays with his army so he can be a general - so he can come back with his army (Ash Spawn). He doesn't go to the fire very often, so the moderates don't have to see him. 
- fires are painful, but everything is nice and peaceful. maline wants this more than anything else 
- The last time it came, [[Groups & Factions/The Auditors\|The Auditors]] were there, plus [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Galen Verix\|Galen Verix]] and other strong Warriors, but now, not so much. 
- the dawn is fractured, and Ehobel has lost its powerful wizard queen. 
- Drache sees that Malin wants them to destroy the tower. He dies before this, and the party are left with a war they can't win. 
- They put it to a vote 
	- Halfbie doesn't care, they figure something out 
	- Mordecai doesn't wanna as they're an innocent priest
- korrigan accesses the tower but is unable to see crystal (Bad perception). He asks halfbie, who spots many small purple crystals lining the walls of the cavern - they point this out. 
- Korrigan goes and touches one of them, "lightbars", as many shadowy figures (similar to the crypts and Ishnmel) two appear. they don't respond. Korrigan tries to pull one out of the wall, and as it comes out, it erupts in a white 
- halfbie asks why the crystals are different. This is an older tower than most. 
	- is no less powerful but the construction techs are a lot older
- Malin explains that he was there when the tower and temple were built. Before the temple was around, there was nothing, just an empty plane. Then, a crystal crashed here, causing a big crater. A dragon appeared, and she would use the crystal to ensure the sundering wouldn't happen again. The dragon spent months and months building something that could use the crystal to stop the sundering. He and the priest gathered to protect it.
- guards wouldn't find his body as no one in the temple goes into the rooms or this cavern 
- Korrigan votes to leave the tower as they don't wanna destroy more than they need to. plus they need time to prepare
- Only a very few number of people know about this room Korrigan shoots the priest with his bow. The arrow shoots through his eye, and the priest dies. he looks up, and a single golden fiery tier runs down his face. his body burns into an inferno. the body turned to ash
- the wonder why Korrigan killed him and Korrigan explains that Malin was one of the few who knew of the tower so it could keep the tower safe for a while 
- Halfbie analyses the crystal and figures its possible to remove a crystal if careful. he does so and messes it up, and it explodes.
- Drache questions them on why he would do this, and halfbie says it's possible and it could allow them to understand the towers better 
- Korrigan suggests they both use misty step to move it. Korrigan moves forward with one half and halfbie appears in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. the crystal explodes in its place in a weird rift in space-time there are stars and galaxies in 
- they stare into the rift, and their heads are filled with being on the beach with a relaxing breeze, which feels like when magic goes through them. it's like the magic being sucked into the rift 
- magic is finite, this rift will keep pulling magic until satisfied - rift is slowly shrinking. halfbie leaves 
- Halfbie recognises the general area in the fey wild but isn't sure where to go. They decide to look for a village.
- Korrigan figures out that halfbie probably went somewhere to do with his misty step. It's not super obvious where they might be. drache is concerned and is slightly mad because it doesn't seem worth it. 
- They figure that Korrigan's fey step goes through Feywild but isn't sure about this as this is more of a chenris thing to figure out. Drache refuses to leave without halfbie and tell Korrigan to go the feywild. 
- he appears in his usual place in front of Lorwyn temple. He senses someone walking to them. they're an elf that looks old and is only wearing a burlap sack - looks like an old halfbie 
- halfbie thinks they're walking well, but they're just walking, but they're going in circles. they walk for a LONG time as they scavenge to survive. they slowly lose their mind and memories. part is consumed by the fey wilds. eventually, they find a fey - Eldarin who lives in a small wooden cottage, very cosy 
- They're invited in it's been like 20 years. food smells good; the eldarin gives them a ladle full of a nice hearty soup with veggies and noodles. they get to rest in a nice warm bed, and they go to sleep.
- Wake up in the morning to eggs, bacon, etc., which are being cooked for breakfast. Halfbie asks where they got it from, and the eldarin says they hunted for it. 
- Halfbie refuses to leave without paying back his debt. they are are asked to do chores. they use prestidigitation to clean and feed animals. animals are weird, mixes of other animals. 
- They offer to let halfbie stay. they say no, thanks them for their hospitality. They're given a burlap sack as a clock. They keep walking for over 600 years and don't encounter anyone new that are sane. 
- They now need to stick to keep walking forward. one day they spot something unmoving (strange in the feywild) they see a gold building - halfbie is suss of the building as it doesn't move, they scope it out. 
- they see Korrigan, and as they move closer, their body de-ages, and they return to normal 
- they explain they have been in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] for 650 years (they have a book where they counted the days). Korrigan began to manically laugh. 
- halfbie explains their adventures. korrigan invites them to tea and food, and halfbie accepts enthusiastically. they give their regards to Titania, and they teleport to their home 
- korrigan takes them back and explains what happened, including that "Stew and noodles are real good"
- They're all thankful that space-time didn't break and decide to head off. 
- They had out assuming that guards won't care or ask, and they don't. they're ignored
- The party decided to go ofc as they needed to sort that out. they will then go [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] and [[Locations/Important Locations & Nations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]
- It is dubbed [[Tour De Ashen\|Tour De Ashen]] 
- They ask receptionist if they know anything the Prince of fire an theyre give [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Pyromancer’s Legacy - The Chronicles of Kaelis Ignithar\|The Pyromancer’s Legacy - The Chronicles of Kaelis Ignithar]]
- there is mention of a Crown, which sounds similar to [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] but none are sure if theyre the same. 
- They set out
