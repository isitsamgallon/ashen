# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
- [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] creates a bag of holding while they try to figure out how to melt the skeleton
- While this is happening, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] checks the painting in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]]'s cave and realises that the masks that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] wear are very similar. 
- Returning, he sits down with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bit\|Bit]], casts Summon Steed, and makes the summon look as close as possible to Uti so Bit doesn't feel lonely. The horse is called Bobs.
- Halfbie uses their Eldritch Canon to start melting down the skeleton and forming it into smaller bars before putting it into the bag of holding. While this is happening, korrigan convinces Bits and Bobs to make moulds in the snow so they can have a smaller version of them.
- As night comes, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] puts up Leomond's Tiny Hut while they work into the night. The skeletons reanimate and notably ignore them and start heading for the castle.
- Korrigan summons [[The Party/Other Party Members/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] uses Beast Sense, so they scout out the area. 
- Zephyr sees them all go into the castle, and the bird follows them in. Inside, all the skeletons are lined up in ranks, kneeling towards the throne. One at the front has their hand up on the throne, waiting for something 
- [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] goes pale (for a tiefling) upon hearing this; Korrigan can't tell that Mordecai isn't being controlled. 
- [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] sends [[The Party/Other Party Members/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] around the whole castle, including the basement chamber where [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]] was. the cultists are gone, but the room is empty, and the castle is empty apart from the skeleton.
- Mordecai wonders if the power of the curse would weaken if they moved away, and halfbie absent-mindedly explains that the curse was possession, and so it would just go with them. 
- Mordecai snaps back at halfbie when halfbie misses some sarcasm and tells them to keep playing with their toys. halfbie exclaims that the canon isn't a toy - it is a machine 
- Mordecai wonders if they should go see [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] to see if they know anything and if they can get rid of the curse
- they ask if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] is talking, and Mordecai refuses to talk to them, and Seifer is pissed that they gave up their sword to 'that bitch'
- Mordecai responds to the voice angrily, while [[The Party/Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] whispers to Drache, asking why they're talking to the voice when they just said they weren't on speaking terms.
- Mordecai wonders if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] can talk to people with the message spell, and they realise that someone at the Nightshade's Crown was posed at one point and realise that possessions  normally allow the spirit to understand the body's senses 
- Mordecai begins to panic and exclaims how they need to sort this out. korrigan wonders what the voice wants and if they're truly an enemy. They half-jokingly plan to annoy Seifer, so they're left alone 
- Aidan realises there are a few differences between Mordecai and his possessions, but it is difficult to tell exactly how deep those differences are. 
- They all turn for the night, with Halfbie keeping the cannon going until the earlier hours of the morning. Korrigan takes over watch for the last little bit. Korrigan watches as the skeletons leave the castle and lie on the ground. Korrigan tries to figure out why the skeletons awake at night but has no idea. 
- When the morning comes, halfbie has created 22 bars. 
- halfbie cannot remember why the gold is important but knows they should have some. They put the bag on their shoulder and set off for the shores to meet with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]].
- They get there pretty easily, and the caption asks if they got anything interesting, and they explain they found some weird old bag. The captain wonders about [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]], and they suggest going around the long way to try and avoid them. 
- They can go near [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] or by [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], and Halfbie explains that they are a trading nation and would most likely let them through. 
- They decide to go through [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], and Mordecai says they would be interested in Halfwit's home nation. They set off, and the captain starts heading in the general direction of [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]]. As the ship gets close, the climate becomes more temperate, and they realise none of them had seen a ship in ages. 
- To their left, they see the edge of sandy shores with a lot of tents. Korrigan asks if they wanna go home, and they say no because they're on an adventure, and korrigan knows that this isn't the full truth. Mordecai uses the message to ask if they're lying, and korrigan says they're not lying 
- Mordecai says they don't trust halfbie, but korrigan likes them because they remind him of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. Korrigan says they might finally be a good person. 
- Mordecai says there are no good people in this world... apart from drache
- korrigan asks who the voice is against, and Mordecai doesn't remember their name but knows who they are. The voice doesn't care if they know or not. 
- The voice says they should put the crown on korrigan so they can see what is in Korrigan's mind. korrigan points out how they said the crown was useless - Seifer is very suspicious. 
- The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] is confused about what is happening. They want to find out what is happening, so they suggest using [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] to cast some truth spell, and Mordecai reveals they have their own truth spell. They can cast it because of Gay audacity. korrigan reveals they have a way to do this, but it'll be a bit invasive on Mordecai.
- Mordecai casts Zone of Truth on the crown, and everyone is under its effects and cannot lie. Korrigan casts Detect Thoughts. 
- The voice says, "Damn it, now they know the crown is useless"
- They ask who the voice is. the voice confirms they are [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]]
- korrigan probes deeper and asks for a lot more information on Seifer and what they're doing 
	- the voice just wants what is best for the world
	- They're annoyed that someone else got away with the sword.
	- It wants the sword so it can come back to life and 'help' humanity
	- Korrigan gets the idea that they're a good person (this is what they think most likely)
- The voice finds this very rude, and korrigan says that this is more than fair since Seifer is in their friend's head. Seifer says they're doing nothing with their head right now. 
- Korrigan says they might be inclined to help them get the sword if Seifer explained who the man in the red mask is. They don't know anything (who knows if they're lying)
- Mordecai says they don't know if this spell has worked properly. korrigan joked, saying, 'Oh yeah, because you're not as good at spellcasting as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Mordecai slaps korrigan.
- Mordecai then asks Halfbie's if they are hiding anything; they reply by saying there aren't many places to hide. 
- the captain admits he had fucked a lot of trolls on this boat when illegally transporting them. He has fucked many people, including his 'boy toys'
- Mordecai gets back on track and says they think halfbie is hiding something, 'I can feel it in my bones, ' halfbie remarks that it is a weird place to feel something 
- korrigan reads the surface thoughts of Halfbie's mind. Halfbie is thinking about how weird this line of questioning is and how weird Mordecai is being. But there is a lot of background rage, which makes korrigan very nervous. they back out of Halfbie's mind and go to Drache's mind to decompress - Drache is trying not to think about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]].
- They vote to go to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], and Mordecai votes for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] so they can fuck with halfbie. They get off the boat, and the captain says it was a fine journey and hopes they enjoyed it. 
- halfbie quietly comments about how weird it was that the captain kept talking about his Sex life even after the truth spell ended. 
- The captain's street name in lil Boat Boy and offered to give them lifts when they need them again. 
- They awkwardly waved and said they should start heading for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] should still be there. Mordecai is mad that they know that name but don't know where. Storming off after saying, 'They know so much but so little.' halfbie says this sounds like Mordecai, not them. 
- korrigan asks them about the plan to open the portal to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] from the power of the towers. He asks how they would feel about this plan. Halfbie says that they feel like they should do it, too, but logically, they shouldn't since it would wreak havoc. 
- korrigan asks if they think it would be interesting to see what would happen if loadsf portals were opened to other planes of existence. halfbie is very interested but says it could destroy the world.
- korrigan moves along and behind to hum a tune they first heard from Mordecai's head and Mordecai goes pale and tries to gain reassurance from Drahce 
- Aidan asks what this is all about, and korrigan says it's none of his business. Aidan argues that if it destroys the world, then it should be his problem. korrigan argues that no one knows what is happening. 
- korrigan starts ranting about how no one knew who chenris was and how they kept making him feel bad. and blames Mordecai for the majority of this and casts the silence of the spell on Mordecai so they can't rebuttal. Mordecai is screaming but can't be heard due to the spell.
- They carry on. and as they walk, Mordecai can hear Seifer pointing out how easily The Party turns on them and how Mordecai is trying their hardest and doesn't appreciate them. Mordecai tries to ignore them.
- Drache marches over to Korrigan, pulls him over, and explains how this outburst was not called for and singling out Mordecai isn't right as they have just as much going as Korrigan. They recognise how close he was to chenris compared to the rest. 
- Korrigan is confused because, in Drach's head, there is so much anger that is repressed. drache says that's ok as it's not outside and not directed at others.
- korrigan says in threatenings that [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is going to run out of patience soon, and he will march down to Lost Haven and bring down that tower - which would leave only a few left.
- drache explains that doesn't matter as he can still try and live his life the best way. 
- korrigan says well met Wurinn 
- Mordecai uses the message to tell Korrigan, "You don't know what you're talking about" - korrigan agrees with them. 
- As they carry on through the dawn, they realise how quiet the nation is; it used to be very loud. It feels like the area is slowly beginning to heal as people figure out what is happening. 
- They decide to stop at a nearby small village near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. They find a local pub that has some spare beds. 
- Behind the bar is a small Gnome who asks what they want. Mordecai asks how they are nowadays, and the gnome says it's quiet as not many people travel past. Mordecai asks if they perform music to increase business in return for some rooms. 
- The gnome would offer the room for free but would love to have the show. korrigan Wildshapes into a cat and tries to join the show by jumping through hopes and doing tricks. 
- Some farmers come in to watch the show and seem to enjoy it while buying drinks. The bartender refuses to charge for these drinks. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks why they won't charge, and Gnome has fallen on hard times. Drache gets a free Ale, and halfbie doesn't know what to drink, so Mordecai says they should have Absinthe. Halfbie believes them and gets the drink and sips it after being told so by the bartender.
- Halfbie gets a bit tipsy, and their voice gets deeper as they explain how the taste is really lovely. Everyone is impressed, and they ask for another. The rest of the room chants for them to get another.
- This one is very hard, and when halfbie speaks again, they sound a lot like [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]?
- The music stops, and everyone is confused. Halfbie is very confused as they don't know what is wrong. 
- Mordecai has a mental breakdown as they say that they are not chenris and halfbie has stolen his voice. Halfbie has no idea what is happening. Mordecai rushes out
- Korrigan uses an illusionary script and make it possible for only Chenris to be able to read a note "Do you want another drink?" and halfbie reads it perfectly and korrigan faints.
- Drake catches him and slaps him awake. once he is awake, korrigan explains what the spell does, and it dawns on drache what is happening 
- halfbie is confused and holds up a note that clearly says, "No bitches?" and says it clearly reads "Do you want another drink"
- halfbie is confused again, and korrigan writes another note addressed to halfbie that reads, "Do you want to go for a walk?" He reads it fine and asks why they're writing notes and why going on a walk is good.
- korrigan and Mordecai storm off to their rooms
- Halfbie asks what is going on, and drache says it would be better to talk in the morning about it.
- the next morning, drache wakes up halfbie, and they are very hungover. 
- draches rushes over to Mordecai and Korrigan's room and tells them they don't remember anything and have a bad hangover.
- Mordecai and Korrigan shoo him away. korrigan says he'll, take a page out of drache book, repress his emotions, and forget this. 
- Seifer exclaims how easy it was for everyone to fall out with each other. 
- Mordecai writes down a list of everyone they need to talk to 
- Seifer asks if Mordecai wants to talk to her. They explain that if they're going to be together for life, then they should at least get to know each other. Mordecai slightly breaks down and says that they're scared. 
- Mordecai recovers and gets ready to leave. they ask how halfbie is doing. drache says not very well and goes to get water. korrigan offers to go to talk to him. Mordecai says it might not be best if either of them talks to him. Especially those who have no filter and don't know when to speak the truth versus what is right for that moment
- Seifer encourages Mordecai.
- Mordecai says it might be best if drache looks after halfbie, and korrigan takes a bit of offence to this. but they both make up quickly and redoubled their efforts to reach  [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]
- as they speak, korrigan accidentally starts talking about Seifer being good, and Mordecai tells them off for gunning for the bad person, but Seifer makes them doubt this when they say that they always lie and deceive people 
- Mordecai asks if Seifer is they also hear the song that loops in their head constantly, and they definitely do. Korrigan likes the song, and Seifer likes the song but hates the consent repeat. 
- Mordecai switches the conversation and says they weren't trying to change chenris, they were fine. Mordecai just wanted to make sure that chenris wasn't being self-destructive. They just wanted to help. korrigan understands; they admit that most things they said yesterday were emotional outbursts. 
- Korrigan offhandedly mentions that Chenris is back. Otherwise, how would the spell have worked? Mordecai wasn't aware of this, so they went downstairs to talk over some tea. Mordecai doesn't like the fact that chenris and halfbie might be two people sharing one body. 
- Mordecai wonders why Seifer is so encouraging. Seifer wonders why they would do that, as they already got half of what they wanted. 
- Korriagn asks what she is saying, and Mordecai says they forget that no one else can hear them. Seifer says they can make it so people can hear them.
- Before Mordecai can say anything, Mord's mouth moves on its own as Seifer speaks through Mord's mouth forcibly. Seifer apologises, explaining that they could take control of a lot more of their body, but they don't because they are friends. 
- They wonder if taking Seifer to the temple is a good idea as they would essentially be taking her to the other follower of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]].
- Mordecai says they have discussed consent with Seifer and are okay with Mordecai being in control. If they need to go to the temple, they can just go there.
