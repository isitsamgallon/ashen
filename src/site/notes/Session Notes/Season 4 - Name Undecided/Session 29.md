# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
As [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] prepared to leave the tavern near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] antics arise with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's first hangover. Noticing the young Eladrin's discomfort, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] decided the most appropriate action to someone complaining that everything was too bright and too loud was to use prestidigitation to create a ringing in his ears to make it all the more uncomfortable for him. Being smarter than [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]] ever gave them credit for, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] used his own version of the spell to cancel out the effect before rushing over to the tavern keeper frantically demanding answers as to why he feels so awful when the previous night the gnome had assured him the absinthe was fine to drink. Taking pity on [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's naivety, the gnome dug around behind the bar to produce a pair of glasses with dark-tinted lenses. Once they put them on, the world dimmed to a more palatable brightness for his hungover state providing a mild [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|bit]] of comfort to his weakened state. Eventually, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] cast lesser restoration to relieve the symptoms and the shades were gifted to [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]].

As they ventured through [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|Dustwood]], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] couldn't help but muse at how quiet it was compared to the last time they had been there. Chatter could be heard from the largest building, piquing all of their interests and ideas started to be floated about possible infiltration. Before Mordecai was able to grab for their make-up palette, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] was keen to experiment further with his new wildshaping ability. Before their very eyes their fey friend shrunk in size and stature, his humanoid limbs cracking and duplicating in odd angles until all that was left was a spider with [[The Party/The Korrigan\|the Korrigan]]’s signature antlers protruding from his tiny head. As a spider, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] scurried up the walls of the building and squeezed his small form into the tiniest crack in the wall to be an unnoticed witness to whatever large gathering they had stumbled across. 

The pews inside the building were full to bursting, the entire town gathered under one roof. As [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] watched, three figures clad in yellow and orange robes emerged into the room. Sun motifs danced across their robes in the light of their flaming swords as fire enveloped the stage. An old man emerged from the flames, his beard and robes seemingly untouched by the flames as it dissipated behind him. With surprising strength and dexterity, he wielded a fiery great hammer as he addressed the crowd - stating that before they begin their meeting any citizen not of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|the dawn empire]] should leave immediately. Fiery magic emanated from his hammer, licking the walls to find any hidden intruders. The magic swirled around the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dustwood\|dustwood]] citizens, leaving them unscathed, before finding the spider form of [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]]. Unable to resist in his minibeast form, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korri]] kept getting pushed further and further back towards the crack in the wall until he was back in the cart with his friends. 

Once they had determined that the fiery display had ceased, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] crawled back through his trusty crack in the wall and witnessed the secret meeting in its entirety. Once the older man was convinced that the eavesdroppers were vanquished, he spoke once again announcing that the Emperor had “betrayed and abandoned” them, encouraging the crowd to resurrect the priesthood and bring back their saviour. 

Once the old man’s spiel had concluded, the priesthood disappeared in an eruption of leaflets that rained down around their audience. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] rushed back to the group, transformed back into his humanoid form, and caught them up on this rogue religious group. The group ventured into the now empty hall to find a couple of leaflets left behind labelling the group as the “[[Groups & Factions/Brotherhood Of The Sun\|Brotherhood of the Sun]]” with a tagline of “Remember the Prince of Fire”.
  
Contemplating the leaflet, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] continued their journey towards [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|the All-father]] Temple. With such fiery motifs, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] couldn’t help but draw comparisons with the group and the cult of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] and asked Seifer Willow if she knew anything about this brotherhood through [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mord]]. However, she was less than helpful - claiming that she had never heard of them before. Unconvinced, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] kept pressing her for information, asking her very bluntly how she died. This provoked outrage from the dead woman in [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]]’s head, demanding that Mord should kill him on the spot for such insensitivity and rudeness. Naturally Mord refused, a little tired of the constant desperation of the woman’s violence towards his party members. 
  
As they arrived, Halfbie excitedly rushed to the door and politely knocked before entering. Tourists paused to look at him quizzically before resuming their way through the open double doors of the temple. Irritated by Halfbie’s naïvity, Mordecai pushed past him - announcing to the group that he wanted to take Halfbie to go see Aeloria with a glint of contempt in their eye.

SESSION STILL IN WRITE UPSTAGE

--- 

Anxious for answers, Mordecai stormed into Aeloria’s worship room, practically pulling Halfbie by the scruff of their neck. Seeing the same orb as the one from last time, their voice came out more like a demand than the question they had intended it to. They asked to know more about what was happening with Halfbie and if it was possible to get rid of Seifer. The orb thought momentarily before revealing that they were more than happy to tell them this information, but it would come at a cost. The orb was willing to trade the information he wanted in exchange for taking their knowledge that Obeus was the Empress of Ehobel. The orb clarified that this would affect the whole party. Mordecai wasn’t sure if this was a deal they could make for the whole party and asked if they could wait for the others to return and ask them for their opinions before. Mordecai was also quite concerned that if they forgot about this, they might not take her back to Ehobel.

They turned to Halfbie, who they were still holding onto, and asked what they thought of the deal. Was it too much to ask? Halfbie, half-joking, asked if they even got an opinion since Mordecai had kind of been talking for them this whole time. Mordecai quickly let them go but stayed true to the fact that they had to know what was happening to Halfbie. Almost shouting with panic and frustration, they exclaimed that Haflbie made no sense whatsoever. Halfbie has some of Chenris’ memories, thoughts, and mannerisms but does not know how they know them all. Mordecai finished their rant by screaming, “Sometimes you’re so smart, and sometimes you’re so dumb, and I don’t know how both can be true!!”

Halfbie gave them a kind smile before saying, “Well, maybe you would understand if you actually just got to know me and… you know, talk to me?” Mordecai was shocked into silence as they realised how little they had cared to learn about the person who was causing them so much anguish. The orb broke the silence by saying they were happy to wait; in fact, they could teleport Drache and Korrigan into the room as soon as they were available. The orb then became very confused, appearing flustered for the first time as he revealed that we were unsure of where the two were. The orb explained that he had knowledge of all the things that Aeloria knew, and the orb had no idea where they were, which would have been impossible unless they were somewhere that Aeloria had no power over. Mordecai suggested that they went to Lorwyn’s room but the orb revealed that this was still a place he could see. It might make sense if they were taken to the Feywild. But that was such a strange idea that the orb immediately dismissed it.  

Halfbie decided to pass the time by praying at Aeloria’s altar, kneeling down and closing their eyes in quiet contemplation. Mordecai would have found the scene quite peaceful if they hadn’t been so concerned by the sight of someone praying on Aeloria. The orb revealed a way to pass the time that benefitted both of them. The orb explained that Aeloria’s library needed ‘processing power’ since there was so much information flowing in and out of the ed halfbie decided to pass the time by praying at Aeloria’s altar, kneeling down and closing their eyes in quiet contemplation. Mordecai would have found the scene quite peaceful if they hadn’t been so concerned by the sight of someone praying to Aeloria. The orb revealed a way to pass the time that benefitted both of them. It explained that Aeloria’s library needed ‘processing power’ as there was so much information flowing in and out of the domain. If Mordecai plugged into their hive mind and thought for them, then the orb would unplug him and teleport their friends into the room as soon as it was able. Mordecai seemed less than thrilled and explained that they weren’t very good at thinking, so they probably wouldn't be of much use. The orb assured them that they wouldn’t be conscious during their processing and that they would mainly use their brain power. From their perspective, they would go to sleep and wake up to see Drache and Korrigan in the room with them.

With little else to do, they agreed. For a split second, the golden glowing orb seemed to smile even though it was featureless, but before Mordecai could say anything, a golden tendril rushed down from the ceiling, jammed into the back of Mordecai's neck, and lifted them into the air. Their bodies began to convulse for a moment before falling limp, and their eyes glowed a faint golden white. Satisfied with the process being completed, the orb began to float over to the altar. The silence of the room was broken when Halfbie stood up from their prayers and turned with cold precision to face the orb. Their kind eyes turned to that of a doctor looking at a patient whose fate was already sealed as they spoke in the low and gravely voice of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if they were alone, and the orb replied in the affirmative. 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if the orb was aware of their situation; each word was said with a heavy level of disgust and anger. The orb said it did in its most nonchalant way. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] sighed and reasoned that there was probably no way to escape this fate, to which the orb gleefully confirmed this to be true. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s next question was if the orb was going to Mordecai everything when the others arrived. the orb confirmed this to be true but said they could be convinced to leave out the details. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] let out a more profound sigh and asked if this came in the form of a deal. The orb explained that they would gladly not give any deals to Mordecai if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave up the memories of their parents, reasoning that details of a person should be bargained with details of other people. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] refused the deal and every counteroffer the orb made. The orb floated in the air, confused about why all their offers were rejected, especially as how easily [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] used to make deals before. They explained that, unlike him, ⚔️ Halfbie still had their innocent intact, and he would be damned if he would be the reason for another's pain and loss of innocents. 

The orb thinks for a moment before relenting and explaining that it will give them this deal for free, shocking [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Confused, they asked how this would affect their deal with Mordecai, and they promised to explain everything happening to them. The orb explained that they would disconnect from the hive mind temporarily, meaning they wouldn't know anything about ⚔️ Halfbie anymore. This way, they would still technically be explaining everything they knew about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Satisfied with this, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] agreed to the deal and returned to their prayers. 

Soon, Drache and Korrigan returned to 🏛️ Lorwyn's room, but before they could do anything, a golden portal opened beneath them, and they fell into [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]]'s room - landing just as Mordecai put down and disconnected from the hive mind. Mordecai feels sick, but otherwise, the experience was just as the orb had explained it to them, they had no memories of what they had 'processed'. They got up and began to explain the situation to the others who were hesitant to take the deal, and when they put it to the vote, everyone but Mordecai voted no. Drache tried to console Mordecai, explaining that there would be plenty of other chances to learn more about [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] - ones that wouldn't cause them all to forget important information. Mordecai is disappointed but eventually understands where they are all coming from and mentally decides to do their best to at least get to know [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] a little before jumping to such rash decisions. The orb made a sound like it was clearing its throat and said they had a side of the bargain to fulfil and explained that, to their knowledge, there was no way to reverse the possession of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]].

With everything settled, the group had no reason to stay in the room and bid their farewells to the orb. As they were leaving [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast the message spell on Mordecai and ⚔️ Chenris Tallfellow ‡'s voices they said, "Glad to see you're not a hypocrite" Mordecai momentarily stopped in their tracks as the rest walked past him out of the room. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was the last to leave, shooting them a quick glance before leaving as well. Mordecai soon joined them as they decided that it might be best if they went into 🏛️ Eldros' room next as none of them knew anything about the god, and it would be a great chance for them to learn some new information.

After going through the door, they found themselves in a massive wheat field. In the middle, a man wearing a large hood was working the fields with an impossibly large scythe. The Party approached the man, who sat on a large log as they talked. The man asked if they wanted or needed anything from him, and Korrigan explained that they had come to learn about Eldros and figured this would be the best place to do so. As the man spoke, he never looked up and revealed his face, instead opting to look at the floor as he spoke. He explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] was the god that ensured the world kept spinning and all things remained as they were. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] tilted their head in confusion, saying that this sounded a lot like [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. The priest admitted that when put like that, they did sound quite similar, but there was one key difference: [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] held dominion over time, whereas [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] held dominion over everything. He ensured that the world kept spinning, people kept being born, and everyone kept dying. [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] ensured that the natural order of the world was maintained. 

Most of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] remained confused, so the priest explained that when [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] chose to manifest, he would often do so as a juggler spinning many plates. Each of these plates could be seen as a natural part of life: Life, death, decay, growth, prosperity and famine. Each of these plates is necessary for the universe to function properly, and it was [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' job to ensure each of these plates kept spinning. If they ever stopped, he made sure they began to spin again.

The priest went on to explain that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] used to look after the dreaming world as well, but he struggled to keep track because the rules were different. He still had to maintain balance over the waking parts of the universe. After a few instances of things going wrong, the god decided it would be best to create someone who would watch over the sleeping world while he focused on the waking world. This caused him to give birth to his daughter, whom he named [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]].

Mordecai asks that if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] has the power over life and death, then could he thematically kill a God? The priest explained that although [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] controlled the force of life and death, the gods were above such concepts and transcended the natural order, causing them to be outside of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]]' powers. He explained that most gods also lived in their own domains and, as such, could not be influenced by other gods. Korrigan asked that if they were to come to the mortal realm, then could [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] kill them. The priest explained that when the gods manifest on the world, they do so by pushing their essence through a pinhole, and the manifestation wasn't truly them, just an aspect of them. Killing this aspect would not affect the actual god[^1]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asked if [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] had any known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]s, to which the priest explained that he didn't. With all their questions answered, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] thanked the man for his time and answered and left the room and returned to tending the fields. 

Outside, Mordecai took a deep breath as they mentally prepared to enter [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]' room. Questioning out loud if this was really the correct thing to do. Drache suggested that I couldn't hurt to ask, worst case, they could all step in to help if it came to that. Slightly reassured, they all entered the room. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] was sitting near the altar reading as they all entered. He greeted them warmly, asking if there was anything he could do to help. Mordecai dodged around the subject as they asked if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] knew of someone called [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that he knew of her when they both fought in the war and explained that she was a great general who gave her life to destroy an entire army Battalion. He explained that in some circles, she is regarded as almost a sudo [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]]. 

Mordecai comes clean and explains that they actually found [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], and she currently has processed his brain. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] looks terrified and asks to know the full story and becomes increasingly terrified when they explain how they found [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]] and then [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]], now on the verge of panic, begged to know that the sword was safe and hidden away still. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] deliver the troubling news that the sword was stolen by someone they suspect to be [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] broke out in a cold sweat and told them to follow him as he walked incredibly quickly for an old man. He took them out into the main library and into the back areas through a door labelled 'Authorised staff only'. Down a few corridors, they walked through a heavily guarded gate and down a steep flight of stairs. until they entered a large and dark room - illuminated only by a pristine white pillar. 

[[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] explained that they shouldn't be down here, but he assumed they needed access to one of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] and a room where no one could hear them. He paused for a moment before continuing. He explained that they needed to kill him because it was the only way for them to justify their being down here after they were finished, and he didn't want to be around for what was to come. Seeing the pillar, Korrigan suggested talking to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] to get some much-needed answers. Getting comfortable, he went through the usual motions, and before long, they stood before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], who greeted them warmly:


> [!quote] 
"Ah, Korrigan, a beacon of light,
Returned to my presence, a joyous sight.
It has been long, though time’s veil is thin,
Since last your voice danced upon the wind.
Your name is a melody, etched in my core,
A bond unbroken, forevermore.
Come, speak to me, share your tale,
For in your words, life’s truths prevail."

Korrigan confessed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] had been killed and updated the being on everything that had happened since they last spoke. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:

> [!quote] 
Oh, Uti, a flame now quenched by fate,
His journey ended, beyond the mortal gate.
Grief weighs heavy, a sorrow untold,
For his light was a treasure, a warmth to behold.
>
And now, a shadow clings to your kin,
A darkness wrestles for control within.
The gods grow restless, their whispers near,
Their presence stirs in the air, I fear.
>
Yet even in these times of pain,
You thought of me, in chains and disdain.
To free my spirit, to hear my plea,
You stood united, a beacon to me.
>
For this, I thank you, with all my core,
Your courage and kindness I’ll cherish evermore.
Though trials loom and storms may rise,
Your strength shall endure beneath the skies.

Korrigan asked if there was any way to kill a god, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:

> [!quote] 
> To slay a god is a riddle untold,
A task not written in legends of old.
Their essence vast, their threads entwined,
With realms beyond the mortal mind.
>
No blade nor spell can claim their breath,
For gods are bound to more than death.
Yet whispers speak of sacrifice rare,
A power to rival, if one would dare.
>
But truth eludes me, I cannot say,
How such divinity might decay.
Beware the path such questions lead,
For gods do watch the hearts that bleed.
>
To kill a god is to sever the thread,
But what follows then, when balance is dead?
Their roots run deep, their essence vast,
A death for a god may never last.
>
Yet to force them out, to break their claim,
To banish their power, unbind their name—
This may unshackle the world’s design,
Restoring the balance where mortals shine.
>
For exile spares what wrath would wake,
A vengeance divine the world cannot take.
So tread with care, let wisdom lead,
For forcing them out may be the deed.
Akin, the steadfast, a titan of will,
Whose heart burned bright, unyielding, still.
He bore the weight of the heavens wide,
To cast the god to the void outside.
>
With arms that trembled, yet did not break,
He held firm the skies for the world's sake.
A sacrifice vast, a life consumed,
In the echoes of time, his name is entombed.
>
The firmament shifted beneath his might,
A god expelled into endless night.
Yet such a price no mortal should pay,
Lest we find ourselves lost the same way.
>
Remember his strength, his burden untold,
A story of valor, in whispers of gold.

(Original question missing), [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]]'s response:
> [!quote] 
Love, the force that none can confine,
A power eternal, a spark divine.
Stronger than steel, than magic or flame,
It weaves through the world, unbound by name.
>
And you, dear souls, are cherished so,
By hearts unseen, more than you know.
Through trials faced and battles won,
The love you’ve kindled shines like the sun.
>
Hold it close, this sacred fire,
It lifts the weary, takes hearts higher.
For in love’s light, all shadows fall,
And it proves to be the mightiest power of all.

Korrigan thanked the god for his wisdom and help and said goodbye for now and promised to help him as soon as they could. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] said goodbye:

> [!quote] 
Farewell for now, but not goodbye,
Our paths will cross beneath the sky.
Though I must part, the bond remains,
A thread of gold through time's vast chains.
>
Walk with courage, steadfast and true,
The world has much yet in store for you.
And when the stars align once more,
We’ll meet again, as we did before.



# Trivia & Notes
[^1]: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] likes to think of this as how the main villain, Darkside, exists. Every time he appears, it is just an aspect of the being, as if the real Darkside entered the world; the weight of his existence would destroy reality.
