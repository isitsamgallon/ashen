# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
Looking at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]]'s golden skeleton before them, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] considered how they could bring it home. They knew that, on average, skeletons made up around 15% of a being's total body mass and that an adult red dragon weighs around 5000 pounds. These bones weigh at least 750 pounds; however, now that they're gold - a material much denser than dragon bone- this number could be in the 1000s of pounds. If they were to have any chance of bringing home a sizes able portion of this gold home on their small boat, then they would know some form of way of lightening the load. Without access to 8th or 9th-level spells, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] decided the best course of action would be to use their skills to create a [[Admin/CLI/items/bag-of-holding\|Bag of Holding]]. This magical item would allow them to carry 500 pounds of any material without having to worry about the weight. 

While they were figuring this out, [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] had stayed behind in [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]]'s cave to see if he could gather any more clues or find anything useful. During his investigations, he found himself staring at the [[Auditors_-_Sepia.png|painting hung above the fireplace]]. At this moment, he realised that the mask they suspected [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Akin Netch ‡\|Akin Netch ‡]] to be wearing was very similar to the one [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]] wore when he stole the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]. This caused a sudden realisation as they remembered [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Unbroken Coin - A Tale of Two Brothers\|the book they found]] in the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Wyvern Cave\|Wyvern Cave]] and how two brothers were mentioned who wore masks and could shape-shift. With his search finished and needing time to process his revolution, Korrigan returned to the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] with [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]]. Sitting near halfbie, who was deep in their calculations, he began to cast a new spell he'd learnt called [[Admin/CLI/spells/find-steed\|Find Steed]] that was fashioned to look like a miniature [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] so [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Bit\|Bit]] would be kept company by a familiar face. He called his new summon [[The Party/Other Party Members/Bobs\|Bobs]].

Sitting back from their calculations and taking a deep breath, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a moment before returning to work. First, they created a set of [[Admin/CLI/items/woodcarvers-tools\|Woodcarver's Tools]] and [[Admin/CLI/items/tinkers-tools\|Tinker's Tools]]. Once these were completed, they began constructing an [[Admin/CLI/objects/eldritch-cannon-flamethrower-tce\|Eldritch Cannon with a flamethrower attachment]], muttering that they had never tested the blueprint, but it should work.  Soon, they had constructed their machine, and it commanded it with a quick incantation to begin melting the gold into bars. As night began to fall, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] cast [[Admin/CLI/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut\|Leomund's Tiny Hut]] as none of them were sure if, with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/The Auditors/Uti †\|Uti †]] gone, the skeletons would stop animating. As the sky turned dark, the skeletons began to stand up, but instead of slowly walking around aimlessly, they began to line up and march towards the castle, completely ignoring [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]].

Nervous of what this could mean, Korrigan summoned [[The Party/Other Party Members/Familiars/Zephyr\|Zephyr]] while [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] used his [[Admin/CLI/spells/beast-sense\|Beast Sense]] ability to see through the bird's eyes. The bird flew over to the cast with great speed, and Drache watched in horror as the skeletons all filed into the cast. The rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] replicated his expression as he narrated what he saw. Korrigan then commands the bird to go inside, and drache describes an alarming scene: All of the skeletons are in ordered lines and completely filled the dining hall. all of them were kneeling before the throne, with the ones nearest kneeling with their arms reaching out to touch the throne. Drache described it as if they were waiting for something. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]]'s face went pale (for a [[Admin/CLI/races/tiefling\|Tiefling]]) as they realised that all of this might be connected to the crown that currently sat on their head. Korrigan makes the same realisation as he checks this friend to ensure they're not being controlled luckily, they weren't.

Mordecai wonders aloud if [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/The Crown of the Lost\|The Crown of the Lost]]'s curse would weaken as they move further away from Itone Isles. Without looking up from their machine, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] absent-mindedly explained that it was tied to them because it was a possession curse. No amount of running away would weaken it.  Mordecai snaps at [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], detesting their choice of words and sarcastically thanks them for their help. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] misses the sarcasm and says no problem. Not caring if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had fallen for the sarcasm or being annoying, Mordecai snarkily tells them to be quiet and keep playing with their toys. Turning to face Mordecai for the first time in hours, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaims, "This-" gesturing to the [[Admin/CLI/objects/eldritch-cannon-flamethrower-tce\|Eldritch Cannon]] ", Is it not a toy, it's a machine." 

[[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s voice was tinged with irritation, something no one had heard from them before. They didn't wait for a reply before returning to the device and tinkering with the magic circuits. Ignoring the Eldarin, Mordecai wonders if going to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] could help since they have a lot of knowledge of the Gods. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], mainly to themselves, says this could work if they talked to [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] and see if he knows anything about the curse. Before Mordecai can comment on the fact that there is no way Halfbie could know Malin, Korrigan asks if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] is still talking to them. Mordecai explains that they don't speak often, but when they do, Mordecai ignores them as they want nothing to do with them. While saying this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] tells Mordecai that they don't really have a reason to talk often - especially after "[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|that bitch]] stole my [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]]." 

While Mordecai begins to argue with the voice, [[The Party/Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] leans to Drache and asks why Mordecai is now arguing with the voice if they aren't on speaking terms. Drache has no clue but states that it might be better not to get involved. Once they were finished arguing with the voice in their head, they began to wonder if  [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] is able to talk to people using the [[Admin/CLI/spells/message\|message]] spell. Thinking back, they remembered that one of the workers at the [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] was possessed once, and they reported that the curse could feel and use all of the body's senses, so they most likely could do this - terrifying Mordecai. Panicked, Mordecai expresses the need to solve this curse as soon as possible; otherwise, things could become much more complicated. Composing themselves, Mordecai half-jokingly states that they could try and be as annoying as possible so that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, leaving [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in hysterics. 

Aidan wonders if there are many differences between Mordecai's and his possessions. But from his vantage point, it's hard to tell what these are, it is clear, however, that there are a few similarities. 

They all turned for the night, with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] keeping the cannon going until the early hours of the morning, knowing that they could just meditate in the morning. Korrigan took over watch for the last few hours, eager to know what would happen to the skeletons in the morning. As the sun began to rise, Korrigan watched as the skeletons left the castle and lay on the ground. 

When everyone awoke, they found that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was able to create 22 gold bars. Looking at the bars, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was unable to remember why the bars were important but knew they were useful for something and loaded them into the [[Admin/CLI/items/bag-of-holding\|Bag of Holding]] before everyone set off for the boat to leave the island. They reached the shore relatively easily, where they met with the captain and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], with them both wondering why they rushed off so quickly after they woke up on the beach. They explained the situation and lied to the captain when he asked if they found anything interesting, saying they found a weird bag and nothing else.

The captain is too worried about [[Groups & Factions/The Golden Fleet\|The Golden Fleet]] to care if they're lying and asks what they want to do. They could take the long way around and avoid the fleet or go the same way they came and potentially have a run-in with a fleet that wants revenge. The group decided to go the long way around and take the route past [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]] rather than [[Locations/Fort Moldan\|Fort Moldan]] since [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they were a trading nation and would most likely not engage with them at all. Mordecai says they would be interested in seeing [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s home nation for reasons they wouldn't elaborate on. The captain starts heading in the general direction of [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]]. 

After travelling for a few days, the dense fog around their ship began to thin, and as the boat got closer to [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]], the climate became more temperate, and they realised none had seen a boat in a very long time. Soon, on their left, they saw the edge of sandy shores with many tents dotted about. Korrigan asks if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] wants to go home, and they say no because they're on an adventure, which is much more exciting. Korrigan can tell that this isn't the whole truth. Mordecai uses the [[Admin/CLI/spells/message\|message]] spell to ask if they're lying, and korrigan says they're not, much to Mordecai's annoyance. Mordecai exclaims that he absolutely doesn't trust [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] they may be powerful, but they can tell they aren't telling the whole story. Korrigan acknowledges this but admits that he actually quite likes the Eldarin; it's almost like having a good version of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] on their team. Mordecai retorts that there are no good people in this world... apart from Drache. 

Korrigan asks if the voice is good or bad and if we know exactly who they are. Mordecai explains that it's hard to tell if they are good or bad, and the name escapes them, but they're pretty sure they're one of the people that [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] mentioned in his notes on [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] says she doesn't care either way, but they should put the crown on the Korrigan and see if they can learn more about the weird one. Korrigan is quick to point out that the voice had said the crown was useless; was this not the case? [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] refused to comment either way. 

This conversation had been done telepathically, leaving the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] out of the loop. Aidan watched them suspiciously while Drache and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] became bored and watched the fish, with halfbie telling drache facts about each one. Korrigan filled them in on the part of the conversation about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] leaving everyone wanting to learn more about the voice. Drache suggests using [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] as they most likely had some form of truth spell. Mordecai reveals they have their own truth spell, much to [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]'s amazement, citing their gay audacity to do whatever they want when asked how they knew it. Korrigan reveals they have a way to do this, but it'll be pretty invasive for Mordecai.

Mordecai casts [[Admin/CLI/spells/zone-of-truth\|Zone of Truth]] on the crown, fingering [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] would also be affected if they shared senses. The spell would force everyone to only be able to speak the truth. Korrigan spent time casting [[Admin/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts\|Detect Thoughts]] on Mordecai to try and gain even more information on the voice. The voice then said, "Damn it, now they're gonna know that the crown is useless."

Through questioning the voice, they learn that her name is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]], confirming many of their suspicions [^1]. Korrigan probes deeper and learns that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] mainly wants what she believes is best for the world. They are increasingly annoyed that someone has escaped with her sword. She wants to retrieve the sword so she can return to life and 'help' humanity. They also think that they are a good person.
[[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] finds this incredibly rude, but Korrigan retorts that they could say the same thing about them reading Mordecai's thoughts. [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] reasons that they are not doing anything wrong, and it is not their choice that they're now stuck in Mordecai's head. Korrigan explains that they might be inclined to help them if [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] would help them. He asks her if she knows anything about the man in the red mask, and she says that she doesn't, much to their confusion. prompting Mordecai to say they're unsure if the spell had worked properly. Korrigan jokingly says that's because they are obviously not as good of a spellcaster as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. Mordecai slapped korrigan, who didn't retaliate, explaining they probably deserved that. 

Mordecai then turns to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and asks, "Are you hiding anything?" to which [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] avoids the question by saying, "There's not a lot of places on this boat to hide anything." Before they could push further, the captain admits (without prompt) that one time he fucked two trolls on this boat when we were illegally smuggling them out of the country. Pointing to a railing and saying Drache may not want to lean there. Drache immediately moves away, slightly disgusted. The captain then pointed to various areas of the ship, detailing his various Sex-capades with all kinds of hookers and his many 'boy toys.'

Mordecai quickly got back on track and explained how they thought halfbie was hiding something, "I can feel it in my bones." [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] remarks that it is a bizarre place to feel something and they should go to the doctor. Korrigan transfers his spell to halfbie and began to read their surface thoughts. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is mainly thinking about how weird this line of questioning is and how strange Mordecai is, but more importantly, korrigan is confronted with a lot of rage that seems to be in the background of all these thoughts. Upon seeing this rage, Korrigan quickly exited [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s thoughts, transferring to Drache's to calm down. The experience visibly shook Korrigan to his core. Meanwhile, Drache was trying his best not to think about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Emmeline\|Emmeline]]. 

Seeing that he wasn't going to get anywhere with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], Mordecai asked if they should continue to Baytown or stop at [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]]. Mordecai voted for [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]] just because they wanted the opportunity to mess with [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] explained that they could go [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Paraton\|Paraton]], but it's another day's journey at the very least, and there isn't much there anyway. The rest voted for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]], and the captain steered the boat away from [[Locations/Kearlin Atoll/Kearlin Atoll\|Kearlin Atoll]]- much to Mordecai's annoyance. They soon reach the [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Baytown\|Baytown]] port, and the boat docks as the captain exclaims how good the return journey went and that he hopes they would consider travelling with him again, as long as the golden fleet wasn't involved in the next one.

[[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] thanked the captain for this help while [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] quietly commented on how weird it was that the captain kept talking about his Sex life even after the truth spell ended and no one wanted to know more. Mordecai asked how they would find him again if he had a name that everyone knew him by. The captain chuckles before telling them he doesn't use names with usual clients and goes by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Lil Boat Boy\|Lil Boat Boy]][^2]. They awkwardly waved goodbye before heading for [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]], and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Malin\|Malin]] halfbie added. Mordecai stormed off, exclaiming, 'They know so much but so little.' Halfbie said they felt this description fitted Mordecai a lot better than them. 

Korrigan walks with them for a while before talking about his plan with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] to open a portal to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] using the power of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits that something inside them lurches at the idea, making them want to do it, but they know that doing something like this could wreak havoc upon the entire Amber Realms. Korrigan rebuts this by asking how interesting it would be to know what would happen if portals were opened to every plane of existence. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] admits that this would be very interesting to see and research, but they're not if it was worth risking the world over. Korrigan looks a little disheartened and walks on ahead, humming a tune that he heard in Mordecai's head while he had [[Admin/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts\|Detect Thoughts]] active. Mordecai flinches when they hear the tune. It was a song he had been working on, and it wasn't finished yet.

Aidan asked what they were talking about when they mentioned something that could destroy the world. Korrigan retorts that it's none of his business. Aidan argues that if it destroys the world that he is living in, then it definitely is his problem. Korrigan argues that no one knows what is happening as none of them knew or thought to ask [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] deeper questions about his plans like Korrigan did. He began ranting about how no one knew who Chenris was like he did, and constantly made him feel bad. He reveals that he blamed Mordecai for the majority of this guilt-tripping, casting the [[Admin/CLI/spells/silence\|silence]] spell on them. Mordecai appeared to be screaming their reply; none of it could be heard due to the spell.

[[Admin/INFORMATION MISSING OR OUT-OF-DATE\|INFORMATION MISSING OR OUT-OF-DATE]]

- korrigan moves along and behind to hum a tune they first heard from Mordecai's head and Mordecai goes pale and tries to gain reassurance from Drahce 
- Aidan asks what this is all about, and korrigan says it's none of his business. Aidan argues that if it destroys the world, then it should be his problem. korrigan argues that no one knows what is happening. 
- korrigan starts ranting about how no one knew who chenris was and how they kept making him feel bad. and blames Mordecai for the majority of this and casts the silence of the spell on Mordecai so they can't rebuttal. Mordecai is screaming but can't be heard due to the spell.
- They carry on. and as they walk, Mordecai can hear Seifer pointing out how easily The Party turns on them and how Mordecai is trying their hardest and doesn't appreciate them. Mordecai tries to ignore them.
- Drache marches over to Korrigan, pulls him over, and explains how this outburst was not called for and singling out Mordecai isn't right as they have just as much going as Korrigan. They recognise how close he was to chenris compared to the rest. 
- Korrigan is confused because, in Drach's head, there is so much anger that is repressed. drache says that's ok as it's not outside and not directed at others.
- korrigan says in threatenings that [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] is going to run out of patience soon, and he will march down to Lost Haven and bring down that tower - which would leave only a few left.
- drache explains that doesn't matter as he can still try and live his life the best way. 
- korrigan says well met Wurinn 
- Mordecai uses the message to tell Korrigan, "You don't know what you're talking about" - korrigan agrees with them. 
- As they carry on through the dawn, they realise how quiet the nation is; it used to be very loud. It feels like the area is slowly beginning to heal as people figure out what is happening. 
- They decide to stop at a nearby small village near [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. They find a local pub that has some spare beds. 
- Behind the bar is a small Gnome who asks what they want. Mordecai asks how they are nowadays, and the gnome says it's quiet as not many people travel past. Mordecai asks if they perform music to increase business in return for some rooms. 
- The gnome would offer the room for free but would love to have the show. korrigan Wildshapes into a cat and tries to join the show by jumping through hopes and doing tricks. 
- Some farmers come in to watch the show and seem to enjoy it while buying drinks. The bartender refuses to charge for these drinks. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] asks why they won't charge, and Gnome has fallen on hard times. Drache gets a free Ale, and halfbie doesn't know what to drink, so Mordecai says they should have Absinthe. Halfbie believes them and gets the drink and sips it after being told so by the bartender.
- Halfbie gets a bit tipsy, and their voice gets deeper as they explain how the taste is really lovely. Everyone is impressed, and they ask for another. The rest of the room chants for them to get another.
- This one is very hard, and when halfbie speaks again, they sound a lot like [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]?
- The music stops, and everyone is confused. Halfbie is very confused as they don't know what is wrong. 
- Mordecai has a mental breakdown as they say that they are not chenris and halfbie has stolen his voice. Halfbie has no idea what is happening. Mordecai rushes out
- Korrigan uses an illusionary script and make it possible for only Chenris to be able to read a note "Do you want another drink?" and halfbie reads it perfectly and korrigan faints.
- Drake catches him and slaps him awake. once he is awake, korrigan explains what the spell does, and it dawns on drache what is happening 
- halfbie is confused and holds up a note that clearly says, "No bitches?" and says it clearly reads "Do you want another drink"
- halfbie is confused again, and korrigan writes another note addressed to halfbie that reads, "Do you want to go for a walk?" He reads it fine and asks why they're writing notes and why going on a walk is good.
- korrigan and Mordecai storm off to their rooms
- Halfbie asks what is going on, and drache says it would be better to talk in the morning about it.
- the next morning, drache wakes up halfbie, and they are very hungover. 
- draches rushes over to Mordecai and Korrigan's room and tells them they don't remember anything and have a bad hangover.
- Mordecai and Korrigan shoo him away. korrigan says he'll, take a page out of drache book, repress his emotions, and forget this. 
- Seifer exclaims how easy it was for everyone to fall out with each other. 
- Mordecai writes down a list of everyone they need to talk to 
- Seifer asks if Mordecai wants to talk to her. They explain that if they're going to be together for life, then they should at least get to know each other. Mordecai slightly breaks down and says that they're scared. 
- Mordecai recovers and gets ready to leave. they ask how halfbie is doing. drache says not very well and goes to get water. korrigan offers to go to talk to him. Mordecai says it might not be best if either of them talks to him. Especially those who have no filter and don't know when to speak the truth versus what is right for that moment
- Seifer encourages Mordecai.
- Mordecai says it might be best if drache looks after halfbie, and korrigan takes a bit of offence to this. but they both make up quickly and redoubled their efforts to reach  [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]]
- as they speak, korrigan accidentally starts talking about Seifer being good, and Mordecai tells them off for gunning for the bad person, but Seifer makes them doubt this when they say that they always lie and deceive people 
- Mordecai asks if Seifer is they also hear the song that loops in their head constantly, and they definitely do. Korrigan likes the song, and Seifer likes the song but hates the consent repeat. 
- Mordecai switches the conversation and says they weren't trying to change chenris, they were fine. Mordecai just wanted to make sure that chenris wasn't being self-destructive. They just wanted to help. korrigan understands; they admit that most things they said yesterday were emotional outbursts. 
- Korrigan offhandedly mentions that Chenris is back. Otherwise, how would the spell have worked? Mordecai wasn't aware of this, so they went downstairs to talk over some tea. Mordecai doesn't like the fact that chenris and halfbie might be two people sharing one body. 
- Mordecai wonders why Seifer is so encouraging. Seifer wonders why they would do that, as they already got half of what they wanted. 
- Korriagn asks what she is saying, and Mordecai says they forget that no one else can hear them. Seifer says they can make it so people can hear them.
- Before Mordecai can say anything, Mord's mouth moves on its own as Seifer speaks through Mord's mouth forcibly. Seifer apologises, explaining that they could take control of a lot more of their body, but they don't because they are friends. 
- They wonder if taking Seifer to the temple is a good idea as they would essentially be taking her to the other follower of [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]].
- Mordecai says they have discussed consent with Seifer and are okay with Mordecai being in control. If they need to go to the temple, they can just go there.


[^1]: [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] later revealed that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] passed the saving throw, and so wasn't under any obligation to speak the truth, and it is unknown if she lied during their process. 
[^2]: His boat may be little, but something else definitely isn't.
