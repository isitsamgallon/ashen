# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
Everyone woke up in their camp spot outside [[Locations/OFC/The Inchling Kingdom\|The Inchling Kingdom]]. Not wanting to be rude, they all decided to leave a note for the [[Other Information/Races/Inchlings\|Inchlings]], saying goodbye and thanking them for the food. [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] ended up writing the note by casting Enlarge/Reduce on themselves so they could make the thing a bit smaller than they usually would, looking for a quill, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] incised that Mordecai used their, summoning an ancient-looking quill from nothingness "It's special - no ink needed!" they said excitedly with beaming smile on their face.

With their note written and left with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Big Dave\|Big Dave]][^1], [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] headed out with their destination set for [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] had marked the general area of the university but soon found that knowing the exact location wasn't necessary, as when they approached the area, Mordecai and Halfbie would feel the magic emanating off of the university miles away. Putting away the map, they followed the magic that filled the area around them.

As [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordecai ventured deeper into the woods, the air itself seemed to hum with otherworldly energy, thick with the scent of blooming arcane flowers and the faint crackle of unseen power. The trees, ancient and towering, glowed faintly at their edges, their leaves shimmering like stained glass in the dappled sunlight. Each step brought them closer to Strixhaven University, the heart of this magical saturation, and the sensation grew almost overwhelming—like standing too close to a roaring fire, yet feeling no heat, only the pulse of raw, untamed magic. It was beautiful, yes, but also dizzying, as if the very fabric of reality around them was alive, whispering secrets too vast to comprehend. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]’s senses tingled with every breath while Mordecai’s fingers twitched as though the magic sought to weave itself through his very veins. The forest seemed to breathe with them, a living, sentient thing, guiding—or perhaps testing—their resolve as they approached the source of its power.

Soon, they reached the border between the normal world and the university. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] seemed incredibly excited and asked if [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] was looking forward to returning to the university. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked back in confusion, stating that they had never been to the university before; they had only worked with some of the mages before their untimely deaths on the airship. Mordecai sighed before pointing out how Korrigan was thinking of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]. As they explained, their voice also became tinged with confusion as their eyes narrowed on the [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] as they tried to figure out what was happening this time. 

They soon crossed the board being greeted by the familiar but still awe inspiring site of [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]]. [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] University stood as a breathtaking testament to the convergence of magic and knowledge, its five floating islands suspended in the sky by massive, pulsating blue rocks that thrummed with raw arcane energy. Each island bore a towering structure adorned with a glowing magical symbol—representing the schools of magic taught within—and was tethered to the central island by colossal, ancient chains that shimmered with enchantments. At the heart of it all loomed the central campus, a sprawling, 4,000-year-old edifice of stone and crystal, its spires reaching toward the heavens and its walls glowing faintly with the accumulated power of millennia. The air around the university crackled with magic, so thick it felt alive as if every breath drew in the essence of creation itself. Beyond the campus, a vibrant residential district stretched outward, a harmonious tapestry of every race imaginable—[[Other Information/Races/Elves\|Elves]], orcs, [[Other Information/Races/Humans\|Humans]], [[Other Information/Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], and more—living side by side, their lives intertwined with the magic that flowed from the university like a river of light and possibility.

Walking through the streets of the residential district, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] passed a magic shop which Mordecai, Korrigan and [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] couldn't help but look into to see if anything was in their price range. The shop front window displayed a dark blood-red cloak that, even from the other side of a plane of glass, they could feel the heat emanating from the cloak. Looking closer, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] figured that the clock gave off a heavy heat which would probably burn and attacker if the wearer was physically harmed. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]'s interest was piqued by an old and slightly burnt book next to the cloak that they slowly gravitated towards. They were about to pick it up when [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] stopped them, warning them that touching things that weren't theirs could be costly.

Mordecai ventured inside to ask about the cloak. The shopkeeper explained that the cloak would cost around 6000 gold. Mordecai tried to haggle, explaining that they were somewhat famous and could advertise the shop when they travelled around. The shopkeeper rejects this but, after some talking, agrees to give a small discount if the party is able to figure out what the items do. he is unaware as the items were brought in from the university when on an expedition.

While this is happening, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] uses the Identify spell to learn about the book, learning it was called the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Tome of Unfinished Stories\|Tome of Unfinished Stories]]. The book had two abilities: 
- Editor’s Reprieve - Once per week, you may **rewrite a minor event from the past 24 hours**, subtly **altering reality** in a way that does not contradict major events. The rewritten event seamlessly integrates into history as if it always happened that way.
- Ink of Forgotten Truths - When you write a person's name in the tome, their past **bleeds onto the pages**, revealing **a hidden fact or secret** about them. The ink fades after 1 minute, leaving no trace.

Excited about the book's power, they used the message spell to stealthily inform [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]], but became dismayed when they discovered that the book cost 8000 gold. Apart from the book and cloak, the shopkeeper highlighted other interesting items: a purple coin that [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] learned could augment luck depending on which side the coin landed on when flipped. Behind the shopkeeper was a display case containing a blade the keeper called the Hallowed Blade. Taking it out of the case, the blade was revealed to be made of a material that embodied darkness. It seemed as though the blade was the very absence of light, shifting strangely as it moved. Korrigan asked if they knew what it did, and the shopkeeper admitted they had no idea, as everyone was too scared to touch it. 

Korrigan asked if he could test the blade, and the shopkeep obliged, carefully handing the blade to Korrigan. Korrigan tried stabbing a nearby barrel, but the blade would not pierce or cut anything. Examining the blade closer, the overwhelming urge to touch the blade took over, and before anyone could stop him, Korrigan touched the blade. As soon as his finger touched it, he instantly felt searing pain as it felt like someone was screaming in his mind [^2]. While Korrigan dealt with a splitting headache, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] weren't surprised to learn that the sword was over 10000 gold. 

They soon came up with a plan to buy the book and then use its abilities to rewrite history to say they had also received the cloak for free. They tried to get the money for the book but found they were short, but [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]] offered to pay the money for them as it was clear how much Mordecai wanted to get this cloak, and they wanted to cover it as a gift to them.
