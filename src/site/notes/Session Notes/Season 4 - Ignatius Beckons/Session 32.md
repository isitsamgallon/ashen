# Session Summary 


# Full Session Notes
[^1] [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] raised his hands before exclaiming that everyone had been lying, and it was time to stop that. With that, a large wave of magic sprung from his fingertips, causing everyone to reveal their actual forms: 
- [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] lost his antlers and his [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] magics and returned to being a regular human. 
- [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] remained unchanged but now had the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder. 
- [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] also remained the same but now had the ghost of [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] standing next to them. 
- [[The Party/Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] lost his connection to [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] and all of his time manipulation abilities. 
- [[The Party/Wurinn Fuuldrusch\|Drache]] remained entirely the same as he had not made any deals with Gods or was possessed 

[[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] looked to the ghost of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Seifer Willow ‡\|Seifer Willow ‡]] on their shoulder, sarcastically remarking how it was nice to put a face to the name finally. She shrugged before noting how weird it was as they were so used to seeing [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai]] but remaining unseen. Looking over to [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris]], they noticed that Halfbie was beginning to have a mental breakdown. As they looked at Chenris, but before they could do anything, Korrigan fell to the floor, shaking violently. Mordecai rushed over to help him, but after a few moments, the shaking stopped. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] looked at Korrigan from across the room and realised that without [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]'s influence, there was probably nothing stopping his memories from resurfacing, that his body was dependent on the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and that being cut off was having bad side effects. As Korrigan lay in Mordecai's arms in a daze before suddenly snapping back to consciousness. he exclaimed that he needed a sword. Confused by their question why, Korrigan replied with anger none of The Party had ever seen before, "I need to kill the king, the king of [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]". 

Taken back, Mordecai explained even if they had a sword, they wouldn't have given him one because of how strange they were acting, Drache seconded this. Korrigan realised this and backtracked a little, explaining he also needed to go there to destroy The Towers for Lorwyn, but more importantly, Chenis was here, and he jumped up to say 'Hi' to his old friend, but chenris didn't respond. With a warty glance at Chneris, Mordecai rushed to the still-panicking Halfbie and tried to help them calm down and introduce chenris. Explaining that they well may already know of them, but this is their old friend who died recently, and as much as they hated to admit it, they all really missed him. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] took a long look at Chenris before stating "Y- y-y- eah, why does it feel like i know him, Mord? Why does he feel like a part of me, a part I cannot escape no matter where I run to?"

Looking at the [[Other Information/Races/Eladrin\|Eladrin]] with pity, Mordecai was at a loss for words. staring at Chenis with suspicion, they explained that none of them really knew what was happening to them right now. Addressing the ghost, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] exclaims, "Why is it when I look at you, I see everything I’m afraid of becoming? But what if it’s already too late? What if I’m already you?" Chenris's usually stern face softened, but before he could say anything, Mordecai interjected and explained that although halfbie and chenris are similar in some ways with their relentless drive for learning and being nerds, they were nothing like chenris as they were kind and compassionate and caring for others, a skill the man in front of them lacked until maybe the very end.

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris']] eyebrow raised before he finally spoke up, "You know I'm right here, right?". Mordecai sarcastically exclaimed, "It seems he speaks?!" Chenris folded his arms and shifted his weight before exclaiming that although this wasn't how he wanted to meet them, it was still nice to see most of them, finding it quite rude that none had said hello to him. Korrigan exclaimed that it was one of the first things he did, but he never responded. Chenris denied the human's claims, insisting that none had greeted him. Aidan stepped forward and greeted chenris, but he didn't respond. Steeping closer, he asked, "How are you holding up?" Chenris finally turned to Aidan before curtly remarking, "I'm a ghost... no" Mordecai couldn't help themselves from letting out a short laugh. Aidan stood for a moment before Saying, "Thank you, Chenris. It was incredibly brave what you did back there for us, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to pay you back." Looking slightly confused, Chenris replied, "I'm not sure who that is but don't worry about my sacrifice, it was my way of apologising. Although, it's vexing that I'm still here"

Confused, Mordecai asked what he meant, and chenris explained that when he sacrificed himself, he had hoped he would stay dead and not in his current state of existence. Mordecai asked why he hadn't tried to reach out or do something, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] is smart but can be incredibly dumb at times. Looking almost offended, Chenris retorted that that wasn't something you say to someone who sacrificed themselves for their friends. He then explained that he didn't feel right interfering with someone else life like that, as it wasn't his.

Halfbie suddenly spluttered, "Are you the reason I keep remembering things or having weird dreams?" Chenris looked at the boy with pity before explaining that those memories were his, but they kept leaking out by accident. He had hoped he could keep it all separate, but something would bleed through when he wasn't careful.

#### The Aspect OF Ebis
Before they could say anything else, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] cleared his throat with a commanding cough before claiming that it seemed that the spell didn't work for everyone and that there was one more person who wasn't telling the full truth. As he said this, his eyes narrowed to the back of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]]. Following the headmaster's gaze, they found him staring at [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Obeus Yelris\|Obeus Yelris]], who looked to be on the verge of tears. With a click of his fingers, she let out a scream, she lost all the strength in her legs and crumpled to the floor. As she did so, it looked like a spectral being was being yanked from her. The being crumpled on the floor was small and bony[^2] but wore the same golden mask as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Ebis Daro\|Ebis Daro]]. "Ah, an [[Named Characters & Beasts/Aspect of Ebis Daro\|Aspect of Ebis Daro]], I presume", reasoned the headmaster. Chenris' eyes narrowed in anger at the Empress, but before anyone could say anything, the aspect stood up and began readying a spell.

The air crackled with energy as the party readied their weapons, every muscle tensed with anticipation. The chamber pulsed with an ominous glow, the shifting mist before them coalescing into a vague humanoid form. Halfbie’s keen eyes flicked to the gathering energy in the Aspect’s hands—fire, pure and destructive.

“Fireball! Scatter!” they shouted, but the warning came a fraction too late.

A roaring sphere of flame erupted from the Aspect’s outstretched fingers, hurtling toward them at a terrifying speed. Drache braced himself, roaring in defiance as the explosion consumed him. Halfbie attempted to leap away, but the blast caught them in its fiery embrace, sending them skidding backward across the stone floor, smoke rising from their robes.

Korrigan, magic suppressed, reacted instantly, his instincts guiding him as he nocked an arrow and fired at the Aspect, the twang of his bowstring lost in the residual crackle of flames. Aidan was just as quick, raising his crossbow and loosing a bolt that shot straight through the spectral mist, while Mordecai, ever cautious, muttered an incantation under his breath, summoning a protective sheen of magic around himself.

For a moment, it seemed their combined assault had succeeded—the Aspect wavered, its form crumpling as though collapsing under its own weight. But then, the mist thickened, reformed, twisted into something far more menacing. A towering warrior took shape, its hollow gaze fixed upon them as it let out a guttural, bone-shaking growl.

Drache, recovering from the previous attack, shot a knowing glance toward Korrigan before letting out a battle cry of his own. With a furious bellow, he lunged forward, great axe raised high.

Halfbie, still singed from the fireball, looked up, their fingers already weaving another spell. But something was different. The incantation twisted, words rearranging themselves in their mind as if guided by an unseen force. The flickering flame in their palms changed, shifting into a crackling sphere of lightning. With a grin, they hurled it forward.

The air split with a deafening roar as the lightning ball detonated, arcing violently through the battlefield. Jagged bolts of energy slammed into the Aspect, forcing it to stumble back as the electricity danced across its spectral form. Drache barely managed to twist away from the surge, the hairs on his arms standing on end from the residual energy.

But the Aspect was far from finished. Its voice rumbled through the chamber, ancient and filled with malice as it began to chant. Power surged around it, the very air trembling under the weight of its spell. Then, with a shattering boom, a wave of pure, devastating force exploded outward—Thunderbolt.

The strike tore through the battlefield, barreling toward the party like an unstoppable force. Without thinking, Halfbie raised a single hand, eyes burning with determination. They spoke, their voice ringing out clear over the chaos. The magic answered.

The moment the spell hit their outstretched arm, it shattered into nothing, vanishing in a flicker of dissipated energy.

The Aspect reeled, momentarily stunned by its failed spell. Korrigan saw the opening and fired, his arrow embedding itself in the creature’s shifting form. Aidan followed with another well-placed bolt, and Mordecai, seeing the moment of weakness, sent a surge of arcane energy crackling through the mist, forcing the Aspect to falter.

With his allies keeping the creature occupied, Drache tightened his grip on his great axe, whispering the ancient phrase only he knew. Sparks erupted from the weapon’s edge as it roared to life, imbued with raw, burning energy. With terrifying speed, he surged forward, each strike landing with devastating precision. Two deep, fiery gashes split the Aspect’s form, flames searing into its very essence.

Off to the side, Halfbie had been preparing another spell. They knelt, pulling a small box from their robes and activating it with a whispered command. Gears whirred, metal twisted, and in seconds, a turret sprang to life at their feet. With a flick of their fingers, the construct hummed, shifting its targeting focus. It fired. A concentrated blast of raw energy struck the Aspect in the chest, sending it staggering. But before anyone could claim victory, the being collapsed into mist once more—only to reappear moments later in its new form.

A massive dragon.

The spectral beast let out an earth-shaking roar before beating its wings, launching itself backward to gain distance. Its maw opened, crackling with untamed power as it prepared to unleash another devastating Lightning Bolt. Realizing the danger, Halfbie gritted their teeth and raised a hand, ready to counter. But the dragon had moved—far beyond their range.

The bolt of lightning erupted forward, zigzagging wildly as it sought its targets. Drache had no time to move—the energy slammed into him, sending him to his knees as his body convulsed with the impact. Further back, Aidan and Halfbie managed to twist away just in time, the outer arcs of the bolt merely grazing them, but still leaving the sting of burnt flesh in its wake. They had to end this, now.

Korrigan and Aidan raised their bows, firing simultaneously, while Mordecai hurled a small mote of fire that exploded across the dragon’s spectral form. As the flames licked at its misty body, Mordecai suddenly felt a strange pull in his chest—his wild magic surged. Before he could react, he was floating.

Drache ignored the tiefling now hovering mid-air, his focus solely on the beast before him. He lifted his great axe, feeling the power surge through him once more. With a final, bone-rattling cry, he leapt forward and struck true, the blade carving through the Aspect’s core with lethal precision. As the dragon staggered back, Halfbie activated the turret once more. The tiny machine shifted forms, its barrels rotating as it transitioned from offense to support. A pulse of healing energy burst from its core, surging into Drache and mending some of his wounds.

The Aspect, refusing to fall, let out one final, defiant roar and conjured another Fireball, hurling it toward them. Drache and Obeus were caught in the explosion. Drache emerged, barely fazed, his fury outweighing his pain. But Obeus crumpled, motionless.

Something inside the party snapped.

Arrows and spells rained down in a relentless assault. Drache, filled with unbridled rage, hacked away at the dragon’s form as Halfbie crafted a powerful enhancement spell, increasing Drache’s speed and power. The turret continued its assault, switching between offense and support as needed.

The battle pressed on, fire and lightning clashing in a violent dance of destruction. And then—finally—the Aspect faltered.

With a final, guttural growl, its form shattered. The spectral mist that had plagued them dissipated for good.

The chamber fell silent.

For several moments, none of them moved, waiting to see if the Aspect would return. But after a breathless pause, the realisation set in. It was over. Drache exhaled sharply, gripping his axe with shaking hands. Halfbie slumped against their turret, exhausted. Mordecai hovered awkwardly in the air, unable to descend yet. Korrigan and Aidan exchanged wary glances, catching their breath. 

They all quickly rushed to Obeus' side as [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] and Mordecai began to heal her with magic. She soon woke up, her expression one of shame and embarrassment





# Trivia & Notes
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Caleb Hamlet\|Caleb Hamlet]] was unavailable for the session but was desperately needed for the combat with the Aspect of Ebis, so [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] played both characters. 
- [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Rowan Hales\|Rowan Hales]] made a joke that [[The Party/Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] and [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] shouldn't have their powers as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]] had forced everyone into their true forms, which removed any power granted by the [[Other Information/Display Tags/Gods & Heralds\|Gods]]. [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] liked the idea and made it the case, much to everyone's horror. 

# Footnotes

[^1]: The session started a little before the end of [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 31\|Session 31]] as [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Jae Knight\|Jae Knight]] was going to be late, so it was decided the time could be filled with roleplay, especially with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]].
