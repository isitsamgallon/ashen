# Full Session Notes
With a quick smile at the rest of the party, Korrigan used his divine senses to see if anything interesting was in the area. Alongside the usual Fae, Celestial, and Fiend readings, he detected a significant presence of Undead. He quickly gathered everyone aside to notify them of his findings. 

Halfbie took this opportunity to reveal that the guards at the wall were wearing armour that "didn't seem to have their best interests at heart." Many party members looked confused until Halfbie pointed out that the armour could behave this way only if it were sentient or magical.

Upon hearing this, Korrigan suggested using his spell, Protection from Evil and Good, on one of the guards to determine if the armour was possessed. However, Halfbie and Drache immediately rejected the idea, arguing that casting unknown spells on formidable warriors could lead to disastrous consequencesâ€”at best, they would be seen as aggressive and imprisoned; at worst, they could be killed on the spot. Korrigan quickly understood their concerns and abandoned his plan, proudly stating that he had learned his lesson.

Aiden returned to the Clerk to ask if they had any information on Shoni Anaphora. Without a word, the Clerk began flipping through his old scrolls, revealing they were in luck. Though the records were usually poorly maintained, Shoni was quite famous in the area, and her record was better preserved. The Clerk informed Aiden that she had returned to the desert a few years ago and could be found in Camp Sophia. When Aiden asked if he knew where Camp Sophia was, the Clerk smirked and told the rogue it was still by the river, as it always had been.

The rest of the party joined in on the laughter, with Drache's hearty chuckle rising above the others as he commented on how typically towns moved around. Once the laughter died, the Clerk explained that Camp Sophia was much harder to relocate than other places due to its significant military presence. Korrigan's interest was piqued at this mention, prompting him to ask whether this military was The Desert's Military or belonged to someone else. The Clerk sighed in irritation and clarified that the desert had no unified force; not even The Watchers could be termed a "unified force." He likened it to the Verdant Peninsula, which had a cohesive military presence. At this, a few guards snickered before quickly regaining their composure.

Drache ignored them and asked who commanded these forces if no unified groups were in the desert. The Clerk explained that several large Nomad Families each maintained their own guards and armies on retainer. Halfbie then inquired if their role was to prevent another Sundering should it occur. He asked whether they regularly checked places like Ember Peak and the Broken Throne. The Clerk responded that they had no part in that and mostly left it to external researchers, adding, "We used to, but for reasons, people stay here."

Curious, Halfbie asked what those reasons were. The Clerk replied, "Well, the desert's quite unstable nowadays. Many families aren't as powerful as they once were, so a lot of the militaries that kept it safe are gone, and... Other reasons."

Halfbie couldn't resist asking if the actual reason had something to do with the guards' armour. This question caused the tension in the room to become palpable. However, the Clerk refused to answer. Drache complained that they had asked very nicely. The Clerk blinked twice before lowering his voice and said, "Tell no one I told you this; ah, well, the armour keeps the soldiers here; it kind of links them to the wall."

The Clerk seemed surprised at his own revelation and leaned back defensively, refusing to answer Korrigan's next question about the armour's origin. Trying to hide their disappointment, Halfbie casually mentioned that the armour likely didn't have the wearer's best interests at heart and probably kept them there against their will. Suddenly, the Clerk became defensive, asking who would say they were there against their will. Halfbie bluntly replied, "Me? Like, two seconds ago," completely missing the point.

The Clerk insisted that the guards wanted to be there, which only confused Halfbie and Drache further. When they pressed for a reason why they would want to be there, especially given the job's lack of pay and security, the Clerk sternly stated, "That's confidential."

An awkward silence fell upon the party as they struggled to figure out how to proceed. Suddenly, Halfbie perked up and asked the Clerk what his favourite soup was. The Clerk, slightly puzzled, replied that his favourite was chicken. "Perfect!" exclaimed Halfbie, who then began jotting down notes in a small journal labelled "Market Research for Restaurant." They thanked the Clerk for his time and left, having exhausted their questions.

In an uncharacteristic move, Halfbie approached the Clerk to shake his hand. In reality, they were attempting to sneak a glance at what the Clerk was writing on his scrolls. Two scrolls were laid out on the desk; one appeared to be of significant importance.

"Speaking of the wall, who built the wall?" asked an intrigued Korrigan. 

"It was a combined effort from the coalition and was planned out by the Grand Architect." Explained the Clerk.

"Ah yes, we're familiar", replied a Korrigan without a second thought. 

The Clerk looked up and was interested for the first time in the conversation, expressing his amazement as very few had met him. The Clerk could help ask what the architect was like, to which Korrigan explained that they were a really nice 'person', with halfbie quickly adding that they were quick to anger but still very friendly, with the rest nodding in agreement. The Clerk surmised that as a genius, he was probably allowed to be. In a bid to get more information, Korrigan said, "Yeah, probably, Shame what he did to that poor creature..."

The Clerk's face stiffened as he asked what they were discussing, but Korrigan was already halfway out of the office. Halfbie learnt on the desk and said in a coy tone, "you know we could explain what that was, but only if you tells us a bit more about the armour..."

The Clerk hesitated before explaining that he couldn't speak any more on the matter, going as far as to say it would literally kill him if he did explain further. Halfbie exclaimed that this was unfortunate before strutting out of the room. Halfbie quickly reappeared to ask if the Clerk wanted the door left open or closed. The Clerk asked for it to be left how it was found, to which halfbie confidently said open and left. 

Once out of earshot but very much still watched from afar, Halfbie exhaled, happy that they had learnt so many interesting things. Particularly, they were very interested that Niaross had such a significant influence on the wall and the towers, which could mean the great wall had something to do with Terathera. Korrigan tried to sense Terathra's presence from the wall but couldn't detect anything [^2]. Halfbie, looking closer at the wall and then at The Verdant Spine, tried to understand if anything was happening. As far as they could tell, the stone had been taken from the mountain range, but it was nothing more than regular rock. After a long pause, they looked at the rest of the part and said it was probably sedimentary rock, but there were no geologist [^3].

The rest of the party didn't get the chance to ask what Halfbie was talking about; they quickly began walking down the path towards Tulan Fort, muttering under their breath about how Geologists weren't real scientists. They suddenly opened their pack, retrieved the map for the Tour Du Ashen, and explained that their next stop was likely Tulan Fort unless they wanted to return to Gimsu to check out the goblins outside of it. They also decided it would be best to carry on to Oceanvale and possibly check out Tulan along the way.

They were making a really good time as they made their way through a wooded area; however, after their encounter at the wall, most weren't paying attention until suddenly, a long stick flew out of nowhere, thudding into Drache's chest. After a short moment of shock, the party jumped into action. Halfbie cast Mage Armour on themselves and conjured an illusionary box as cover when they saw a second arrow fly from behind the tree line. With a brief moment of reprieve, Halfbie looked at the arrows only to learn that they were most likely tree branches that had been magically augmented to act as arrows. 

Taking command, Halfbie told Drache to charge into the forest once they signalled to do so. The rest nodded as Halfbie turned to where the arrows originated from and began to cast Fireball. The party watched as a mote of fire started to form in their hands before suddenly disappearing and being replaced with what could only be described as a pure magical force. Spieing everyone's confused looks, Halfbie explained that they didn't want to burn the forest down with an accidental fire. The rest shot Korrigan[^4] a look before agreeing that this was for the best. Halfbie then threw the mote of force into the forest, causing a massive exposure and clearing out a few enemies and a portion of the first for them to fight in. They then gave the signal, and Drache went rushing in. 

Unbeknownst to them, the party was attacked by a Druid with a pack of wolves. Halfbie's Fireball had killed a few of the wolves, and Drache finished off the others. The druid proved a bit more difficult as it fired its bow from the cover of trees and bushes. Eventually, they corner the druid somewhat using Halfbie's Web spell. Drache was about to hit the druid before Wild Shaped into a large spider and began to fight back with fangs and poison. Eventually, the druid was defeated, with Korrigan making sure it wasn't killed as he seemed to recognise the druid at the last moment. It was then revealed that Korrigan knew the druid, Sylva Riverstone, from his dreams as his 'friend'. 

Once they realised this, the party healed her back to health so they could chat. Korrigan exclaimed that he had seen Sylva in his dreams and had been worried about her; she coyly remarked that if he missed her so much that he dreamed about her, he should've gotten in contact sooner. When asked, she explained that she was attached because these were her woods, and most of the people who ventured through weren't very kind and often tried to kill the animals around them. 

Korrigan explained to the group that they used to work together on the other side of the mountain, close to the board of the Uvam Dynasty. She must've travelled down to this forest afterwards, which would explain why they hadn't run into each other since they had been down to this region before. Sylva elaborated by saying she moved here when the Fruit Cutters cut down their tree house, which outrages Halfbie, who had wanted to go to one ever since they were little and even offered to help Sylvia get revenge. Before they knew it, they had all decided to go and get revenge, with Sylvia taking it one step further and announcing that they should kill all the fruit Cutter for all the crimes they committed. The party was less enthusiastic about this; however, it was easily convinced. 

Drache wanted to join as he reasoned that Emmalyn was fighting them for a reason but didn't want to kill everyone. Korrigan asked if Sylvia had ever run into Emmalyn, but she had no clue who that was. Hlafbie revealed they thought every woman knew every other woman. They quickly explained that their mother knew everyone in their home town when Sylia glared at them for such a sexist remark. However, when Halfbie came to mention their home town, their voice trailed off as they realised they did not know where this was [^5].
