The event where [[Redmund Verix †]] led a human revolt against the [[Grayfall Empire]] who had been keeping them slaves. It took place at the turn of the [[5th Era]]. It was an incredibly bloody conflict which saw the merciless killing of any dwarves found whether they were good or bad. The Cleansing eventually led to the formation of [[The Dawn Empire]], led by Redmund's distant son, [[Galen Verix ‡]].

In [[Session 24]], [[The Party]] learned that [[Iron Forge]] was one last few places left for the dwarves to survive on the [[Verdant Peninsula]] before that was eventually taken over as well. The last of the Dwarves were evacuated by [[Werrec Whitshield]] to what is now known as [[Fort Moldan]].
