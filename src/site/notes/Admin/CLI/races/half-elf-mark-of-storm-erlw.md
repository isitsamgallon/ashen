## Traits

### Age

Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.

### Size

Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.

### Windwright's Intuition

When you make a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or any ability check involving [navigator's tools](/Admin/CLI/items/navigators-tools.md), you can roll a `dice: d4|avg|noform` (`d4`) and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

### Storm's Boon

You have resistance to lightning damage.

### Headwinds

You know the [gust](/Admin/CLI/spells/gust-xge.md) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [gust of wind](/Admin/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Storm Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
