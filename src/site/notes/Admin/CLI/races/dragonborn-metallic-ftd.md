### Breath Weapon

When you take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d10|avg|noform` (`2d10`)), 11th level (`dice: 3d10|avg|noform` (`3d10`)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d10|avg|noform` (`4d10`)).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Draconic Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Metallic Ancestry.

### Metallic Breath Weapon

At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:

- **Enervating Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until the start of your next turn.  
- **Repulsion Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Description

Dragonborn with metallic ancestry lay claim to the tenacity of metallic dragons—brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver—whose hues glint in their scales. Theirs is the fire of hearth and forge, the cold of high mountain air, the spark of inspiration, and the scouring touch of acid that purifies.
