# Hill Rune
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 45*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level

This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
