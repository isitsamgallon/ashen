# Blind Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41*  

You have [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
