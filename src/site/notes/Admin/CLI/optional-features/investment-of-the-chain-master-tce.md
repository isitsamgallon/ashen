# Investment of the Chain Master
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 71*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Chain

When you cast [find familiar](/Admin/CLI/spells/find-familiar.md), you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:

- The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of 40 feet.  
- As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action.  
- The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.  
- If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.  
- When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it resistance against that damage.
