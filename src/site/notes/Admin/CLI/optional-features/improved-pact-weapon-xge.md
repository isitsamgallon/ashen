# Improved Pact Weapon
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 57*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

Finally, the weapon you conjure can be a [shortbow](/Admin/CLI/items/shortbow.md), [longbow](/Admin/CLI/items/longbow.md), [light crossbow](/Admin/CLI/items/light-crossbow.md), or [heavy crossbow](/Admin/CLI/items/heavy-crossbow.md).
