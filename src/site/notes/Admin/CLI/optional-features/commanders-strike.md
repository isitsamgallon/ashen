# Commander's Strike
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 74*  

When you take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
