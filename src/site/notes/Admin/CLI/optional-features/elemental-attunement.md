# Elemental Attunement
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces within 30 feet of you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.  
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.  
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.  
- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.
