*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  

When you make a Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)), a Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)), or a Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.
