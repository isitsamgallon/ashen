# Wither and Bloom
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a withered vine twisted into a loop
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke both death and life upon a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 2d6|avg|noform` (`2d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical vegetation in that area withers.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area can spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot above the 2nd, and the number of Hit Dice that can be spent and added to the healing roll increases by one for each slot above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Admin/CLI/classes/druid.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Admin/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Admin/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/Admin/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Admin/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
