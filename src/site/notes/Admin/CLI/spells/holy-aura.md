# Holy Aura
*8th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the spell ends.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/Admin/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/Admin/CLI/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
