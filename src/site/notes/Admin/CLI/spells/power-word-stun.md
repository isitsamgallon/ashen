# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned). Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

**Classes**: [Bard](/Admin/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Sorcerer](/Admin/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/Admin/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/Admin/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
