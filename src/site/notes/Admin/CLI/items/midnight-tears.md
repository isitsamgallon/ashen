# Midnight Tears
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 1,500 gp

A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:9d6|text(31)` (`9d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
