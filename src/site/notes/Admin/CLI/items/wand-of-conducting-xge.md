# Wand of Conducting
*WD|DMG, minor, common*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
