# Rod of Resurrection
*RD|DMG, major, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Rod%20of%20Resurrection.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [heal](/Admin/CLI/spells/heal.md) (expends 1 charge) or [resurrection](/Admin/CLI/spells/resurrection.md) (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
