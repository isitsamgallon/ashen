A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of "the Water Ashari", was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield itâ€”one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.

## Dormant

While the Spire of Conflux is in a dormant state, the staff has 8 charges and regains `dice: 1d4 + 2|avg|noform` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [burning hands](/Admin/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) (1 charge) or [fireball](/Admin/CLI/spells/fireball.md) (3 charges).

Additionally, while holding this staff, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC increases by 1.
