# Cloak of Many Fashions
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/XGE/Cloak%20of%20Many%20Fashions.webp#right)  


While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties.
