### Overview
The priest that represents [[Ignatius]] in [[The All-Father Temple]]. He considers himself a moderate in the faith, condemning [[The Sundering]] for its huge loss of life and immense suffering. However, it was revealed that he originally fought in the war as a commander of an [[Ash Spawn]] legion. He has since seen the error of his ways and left to right his wrong.
