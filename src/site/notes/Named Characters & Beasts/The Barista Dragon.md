### Overview
The dragons that run the Cafe in [[Strixhaven]]'s teleport centre. They were first encountered in [[Session 05]] when [[The Party]] were waiting for their gater to be ready, and [[Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] wanted to get a drink. Unfortunately, the drink was sized and cost a lot more than what any of them had on hand. To pay the debt, [[Mordecai Reverence]] traded their prized amulet for the coffee
