### Overview
Magic Demons are powerful trickster entities which are known to be the primary inhabitants of [[The Realm of Mana]]. They were first encountered by [[Chenris Tallfellow โก]] when he met [[Agolin Winterbor]] and learned they had turned him mad during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. They were later accounted for again in [[Session 15]] during the destruction of [[The Tower of Ishnmel]]. 

in [[Session 31]], [[The Party]] met [[Strixhaven]]'s headteacher, [[Haldir Heleyarus]], who explained how, during a research study, he sent students into [[The Realm of Mana]] to harvest more crystals to create [[The Towers]]. sadly, the trip was one way and would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Magic Demons]]. 

It seems that the [[Magic Demons]] retain some of their memories and personalities after their creations, as two of [[Agolin Winterbor]]'s friends were turned into these creatures and came back to haunt him and turn him mad. 

[[Ebis Daro]] seems to be affiliated with them.
