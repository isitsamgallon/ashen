### Overview
The leader of the [[Seelie Court]] in the [[Feywild]]. Like many fey creatures, she is mischievous and likes to play pranks on people, sometimes very cruel ones. She seems to have a particular disdain for [[The Korrigan]] due to his nature of being a human transformed into the Fey by [[Lorwyn]].
