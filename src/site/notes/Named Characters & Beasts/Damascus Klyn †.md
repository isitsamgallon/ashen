### Overview
Damascus Klyn is the former leader of [[The Tulan Fort]]. Having run the fort for a little over 20 years, he is known as a cruel and vindictive person who loves to watch people suffer.

### Notable Information 
- Towards the end of his tenure as leader, his troops started to lose faith in him when he sided with [[The Dawn Empire]] in [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], a battle they notably lost even though the odds were in his favour. 
- He notably captured and tortured [[Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] 's lover, [[Emmeline]] and took great delight in watching the first suffer as he forced the Dragonborn to choose if she or [[Mordecai Reverence]] would live. 
- He is an incredibly skilled fighter as shown when he seemingly effortlessly beat Drache many times in combat. 
- He was only killed when [[Vormomli Bronzehand]] betrayed him and shot him in the back of the head with a crossbow.
