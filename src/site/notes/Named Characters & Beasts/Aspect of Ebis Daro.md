### Overview
First encountered in [[Haldir Heleyarus]] 's office in [[Session 32]]. An Aspect is almost like an magical copy of [[Ebis Daro]] that he sends to try and kill [[The Party]]. Due to it being a magical construct, killing it does not kill [[Ebis Daro]] and it also as the ability to shapeshift into other forms when it is damaged too much.
