### Overview
Witherfeather is a powerful mage that was first mentioned by [[The Korrigan]] as a way to break [[Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] out of this contract with the [[Ivory Crest]]. It was revealed that Korrigan was also a part of the [[Ivory Crest]] 5 years ago and Terrance helped him escape the contact when the effect weakened over time. He freed both of them by transferring the ownership over to a new party and then giving them the contract so that they were always in control. 

### Notable Informationhe start of the story he was chased out of [[Dawnhaven]], presumably for freeing many slaves.
- Terence was then captured in [[Nightshade's Crown]] by [[Arwen Gryffon]] and was forced to use his powers to help steal from people and in-slave them to Arwen. This is presumably where he also met [[Mordecai Reverence]].
