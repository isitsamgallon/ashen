### Overview
Witherfeather is a powerful mage that was first mentioned by [[The Party/The Korrigan/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] as a way to break [[The Party/Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] out of this contract with the [[Groups/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]]. It was revealed that Korrigan was also a part of the [[Groups/Ivory Crest\|Ivory Crest]] 5 years ago and Terrance helped him escape the contact when the effect weakened over time. He freed both of them by transferring the ownership over to a new party and then giving them the contract so that they were always in control. 

### Notable Information & History 
- 3 years before the start of the story he was chased out of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], presumably for freeing many slaves.
- Terence was then captured in [[Locations/Uvam Dynasty/Minatota/Nightshade's Crown\|Nightshade's Crown]] by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Arwen Gryffon\|Arwen Gryffon]] and was forced to use his powers to help steal from people and in-slave them to Arwen. This is presumably where he also met [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]]. 
- Witherfeather was instrumental in fighting during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Him and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Agolin Winterbor\|Agolin Winterbor]] were used by [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] to create very stormy weather to stop [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] from being able to attack the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] by sea. 
- After korrigan asked him if there was any way to stop someone form influencing and changing his memories, Terrence told a story of how he was once being fucked in the head by a ghost and created his own version of the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Crown of Trues Sight\|Crown of Trues Sight]] and suggested they go and find that.
