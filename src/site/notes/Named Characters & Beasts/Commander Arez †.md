### Overview
A high-up Dragonborn commander in [[The Dawn Empire]]. He was only ever seen wearing his armour made from pelts and hides made from the many strong beasts he had slain over the years.

### Notable Information
- The way he fought and presented himself, Arez was a massive pervert who took great joy in killing and taunting his prey. He was killed, alongside [[Caden SteelBreaker †]], in [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. 
- His most memorable moment during the fight was when he counter-charmed [[The Korrigan]] and had him attack [[The Party]]. Korrigan was able to break free and ripped him apart with [Thorn Whip](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thorn-whip) towards the end of the fight.
