### Overview
Lord Ulan (his first name was never revealed) was the former lord of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. He was a very unfit, gross and horrible man, especially to his son [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. This was especially evident when he didn't even know if his son was alive, assuming he was still locked up in his room for the last decade when, in reality, he had escaped some years ago. He also tortured and killed his son's lover, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]] which put Steve on the warpath to kill his father. 

### Notable Information & History  
- After investigating Steve's room, [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] found his diary describing his father as a very kind and caring man until some unknown event turned him into the sick and twisted man that he is now.
