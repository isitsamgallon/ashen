### Overview
The former lord of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]]. he was very unfit a horrible man, especially to his son [[The Party/Other Party Members/Steve Ulan\|Steve Ulan]]. He notably didn't even know if his son was even alive assuming he had be locked up in his room for the last decade, when in reality he had escaped some years ago. He also tortured and killed his son's lover [[Named Characters & Beasts/Mistrel †\|Mistrel †]].

The lord notably wasn't always as bad as he was when [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] met him. After investigating Steve's room, [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] found his diary describing his father as a very kind and caring man until some unknown event turned him into the sick and twisted man that he is now. 

He was later killed by Steve when he escaped [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] so he could get revenge for his lover.
