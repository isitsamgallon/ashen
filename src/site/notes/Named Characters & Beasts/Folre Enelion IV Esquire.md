### Overview
The Lord of [[Enelion]]. [[Chenris Tallfellow โก]] was forced to have a long, very misogynistic conversation with him to try and gain [[Lord Enelion's Favour|his favour]]. Chenris hoped this would aid them in getting a trade deal between [[Ehobel]] and the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. Flore seemed to be constantly accompanied by guards and many sex slaves who were all under the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm) spell.
