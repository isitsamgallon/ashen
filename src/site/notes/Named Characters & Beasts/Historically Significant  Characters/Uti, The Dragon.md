### Overview
Uti is a dragon and allegedly the last person to ever talk to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]] before [[The Party/The Korrigan/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] made contact with it. They were described as a red dragon from a far-off land called [[Locations/Itone\|Itone]]. Their story was eventually adapted into a popular book called [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Loneliest Dragon\|The Loneliest Dragon]]. 

### Notable Information & History 
- According to the [[Groups/Religious Organisations/The Golden Ones\|priest]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]], there is a specific way that you must talk to Uti or they will attack you on site. Unfortunately, this, and the knowledge of how to correctly talk to Uti, was lost due it to being contingent on a deal with [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] - a deal neither of them took.
