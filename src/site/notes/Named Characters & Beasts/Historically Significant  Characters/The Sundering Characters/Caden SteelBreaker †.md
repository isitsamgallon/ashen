### Personality
Caden was a kind and honourable man. He was also incredibly charismatic with many of the citizens looking up and idolising him.  

### Description
Caden had a short, well-maintained haircut and beard and could often be found wearing armour of incredible quality with many military rankings and insignia on it. 

### Other Information & History
- After [[The Sundering]], [[Ashira Yelris †]] found herself trapped in a love triangle with [[Caden SteelBreaker †]] and [[Galen Verix ‡]]. Ultimately she falls for Caden but it's considered Taboo to marry humans in Elvin culture so she promises to love Caden forever in secret.
- Soon after she returned to [[Ehobel]], she was known to constantly leave the palace at night time and only return in the early hours of the morning looking incredibly drained. Over time she became so weak that she passed away. 
- This explosion also caused a wyvern to attack the area. During the chaos of the attack, no one noticed when [[Xekai]] secretly caused the tree to fall onto Caden's body, killing him. His death was verified and his body was brought back to Blackwall.
- Later on, the party adventured out to [[The Emerald Fort]] and met [[Genevieve †]] who revealed that Caden was originally a part of The Dawn but defected to help from the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. It was also revealed that he fought in [[The Sundering]] 250 years ago.
