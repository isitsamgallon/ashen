# The Teachings of [[High Priest Lyrion]]

### On Devotion
L.1. True devotion to [[Ignatius]] is found in the flames of sacrifice. To give oneself wholly to the Cleansing Flame is to embrace purity and rebirth. The [[Ash Spawn]] are the pinnacle of this devotion, eternal servants of our god's will.

### On Purification
The world is tainted by corruption and sin. Only through fire can it be cleansed. We, [[The Ashen Cult]], are the instruments of this purification. Our duty is to spread the holy fire, to burn away the old and make way for the new.

### On the Return of [[Ignatius]]
[[Ignatius]] 's return is inevitable. Though his physical form was struck down, his essence remains eternal. We must remain vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to welcome him back. In his return, the world shall be reborn in divine fire.
