### Overview
The emperor of the remains of the [[Grayfall Empire]]. They are seen as a more measured and compassionate dwarf, who took up the mantle of leadership.

Under Werrec Whitshield's guidance, the [[Grayfall Empire]] underwent a transformation. He refocused efforts from revenge to survival and reconciliation. Abolishing the position of emperor, Werrec sought to rebuild and integrate his people into their new circumstances. His leadership marked a new chapter in the dwarven legacy, one characterised by peace and cooperation rather than conflict and conquest.
