### Overview
An ancestor to [[Galen Verix ‡]] and the founder of [[The Dawn Empire]]. He was a human slave in the [[Grayfall Empire]] until he took advantage of the chaos created by [[Dhuggith Broadcloak †]] and started a revolution. This monumental shift in power marked the end of the [[4th Era]] and ushered in the beginning of the [[5th Era]].
