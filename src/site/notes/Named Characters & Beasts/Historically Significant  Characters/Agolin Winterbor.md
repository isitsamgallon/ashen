### Overview
Winterbor was the mad wizard that Chenris Tallfellow encountered during [[the War for the OFC's Freedom]]. He was last seen in one of the basement rooms of the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]] [[Mage's Guild]]. According to renowned wizards such as [[Terence Witherfeather]] and Enel Cubus, he was an incredible mage who surpassed many in terms of knowledge and power. Winterbor had a particular interest in weather and weather manipulation; however, at some point, he was driven mad by [[Magic Demons]].

In [[Session 31]], it was revealed by [[Haldir Heleyarus]] that the [[Magic Demons]] responsible for his madness were originally his closeted friends from [[Strixhaven]]. Sometime after [[the Sundering]] and the creation of [[The Towers]], [[Strixhaven]] was researching [[The Realm of Mana]] and how to access it to acquire more crystals needed for the construction of the tower. While at the university, Winterbor was not considered as powerful as his two best friends, as their magic was much more destructive compared to his manipulation abilities. Consequently, they were sent on a mission instead of him. Unfortunately, the journey turned out to be a one-way trip, and his friends perished there.

### Notable Information 
During [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], [[Chenris Tallfellow โก]] met Winterbor to ask if he could manipulate the weather to create a storm to stop enemy ships from forming able to approach. He agreed, but not before two [[Magic Demons]] appeared on his shoulder, telling Chenris, "You don't want to know".
