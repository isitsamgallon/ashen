### Overview
Winterbor is a mad wizard found in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. He is currently located in the basement of the [[Groups & Factions/Mage's Guild\|Mage's Guild]], Where they put all of their problem wizards. According to great wizards such as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Terence Witherfeather\|Terence Witherfeather]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Enel Cubus †\|Enel Cubus †]], he was an amazing mage who outclassed many in terms of sheer knowledge and power. He had a particular interest in weather and weather manipulation, however, at some point he was driven mad some time ago and it isn't clear how. 

During [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]], [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] went to meet Winterbor to ask if he was able to manipulate the weather to create a storm to stop enemy ships from forming able to approach. He agreed but not before two [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] appeared on his shoulder telling Chenris "You don't want to know".

Chenris theorises that these demons are linked to Winterbor's sudden descent into madness.
