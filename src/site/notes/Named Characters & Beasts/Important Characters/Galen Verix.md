### Overview
Galen Verix is the current Emperor of [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]], currently residing in [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]], in a massive palace and a known [[Other Information/Perpetual\|Perpetual]]. He is a distant relative of [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] and like many people in The Dawn, has a particular hatred for Elves due to the ongoing tensions with [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]]. However, if proper etiquette is followed he can show some patience. 

He is particularly renowned as an impressive fighter who fought during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] as leader of one of the main factions in [[Groups/The Coalition\|The Coalition]]. This has led to an almost obsessive personality when it comes to stopping any future attempts to bring the Gods and, more importantly, [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] down to [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was also revealed that he was incredibly in love with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Ashira Yelris †\|Ashira Yelris †]], an affection that was not returned, much to his dismay. 

### Personality
When the party first met Galen, he was a mean, vindictive and incredibly racist man who did not seem to care about the welfare of his citizens or his people as long as he got what he wanted. At times he often came across as obsessive, fixating on blind loyalty and the preservation of [[Admin/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]].

### History
- After learning of the party's newfound leadership over the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]], he invited (Through [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Xekai\|Xekai]]) them to his palace to inform them that he was going to march into the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] and they could accept his arrival or die trying to stop him. 
- After some questions, it was eventually revealed he wanted the area due to its strategic importance in the fight against [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] as well as its access to the seas for trade. 
- [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]], initially suggested that the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] could leave and find another place to call home, however, Verix hated this idea due to the potential uprising that could happen in the future - which he absolutely couldn't allow. After some pondering, Chenris suggested using The Emperor’s propaganda team to make the emperor sound merciful like he cares for the people of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Suggesting that they could say that [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] might have plans to invade the area due to its strategic importance in the war. The emperor could then move these people to a location where he has a better ability to control/ gather Intel on the people. He seemed pleased with this idea and allowed [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] to leave, saying his people would be in touch. 
- Finally, [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] ended their meeting with the emperor, however, [[The Party/Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] was unaware of royal etiquette and turned his back on the emperor leading to him being filled with rage and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Xekai\|Xekai]] having to help Drache do things properly. 
- He, and his commanders [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/Caden SteelBreaker †\|Caden SteelBreaker †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Commander Arez †\|Commander Arez †]], were defeated by [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] during [[History & Events/The War for the OFC's Freedom\|The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. Galen was actually defeated multiple times be would be resurrected again after a few moments by dark magic.
- It was later revealed in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 17\|Session 17]] that he and many of his guards had gone missing leaving the empire defenceless and vulnerable to attacks from monsters and bandits.
- It was later revealed in [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 25\|Session 25]] that [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Velthis\|Velthis]] and [[Groups/The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven\|his circle]] were behind the disappearances and had secretly taken control of the city.
