### Overview
Uti is a dragon and allegedly the last person to ever talk to [[The Golden Being]] before [[The Korrigan]] made contact with it. They were described as a red dragon from a far-off land called [[Itone Isles]]. Their story was eventually adapted into a popular book called [[The Loneliest Dragon]]. They were later revealed to be [[Niaross †]] and lived on the [[Itone Isles]] guarding the [[Firesoul Greatsword]] for the likes of [[Ebis Daro]]. They were sworn to kill anyone who entered the island to make sure Ebis couldn't sneak on. They were later killed by [[The Party]] when they travelled to Itone to learn more about [[Terathra]]. 

### Notable Information
- According to the [[The Golden Ones|priest]] of [[Aeloria]] in [[The All-Father Temple]], there is a specific way that you must talk to Uti or they will attack you on site. Unfortunately, this, and the knowledge of how to correctly talk to Uti, was lost due it to being contingent on a deal with [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[Mordecai Reverence]] - a deal neither of them took.
