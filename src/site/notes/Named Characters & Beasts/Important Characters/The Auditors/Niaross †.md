### Overview
The Grand Architect. A mysterious member of [[The Auditors]] who was the primary creator of [[The Ancient Pillars]] and is specifically mentioned as the person who created [[The Tower of Ishnmel]] with the help of [[Ashira Yelris †]]. They were later revealed to be Uti † and lived on the [[Itone Isles]] guarding the [[Firesoul Greatsword]] for the likes of [[Ebis Daro]]. They were sworn to kill anyone who entered the island to make sure Ebis couldn't sneak on. They were later killed by [[The Party]] when they travelled to Itone to learn more about [[Terathra]]. 

### Notable Information
- They were first mentioned in [[The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] in a very negative light. This was most likely due to him creating [[The Towers]] that used to hold back the Gods - including [[Ignatius]]. 
- They also seem to be connected to [[The All-Father]] due to their involvement with [[The Towers]] and their ability to drain [[The All-Father]] 's power.
