### Overview

He seems to have some form of plan for [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] but is unwilling to explain what it is. He was first introduced to [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]] when they snuck into the councillor's offices to learn secrets that could help them in their quests. He was already in the office when they found him, looking through documents for reasons he refused to reveal. He didn't stick around long before opening a portal and escaping.
