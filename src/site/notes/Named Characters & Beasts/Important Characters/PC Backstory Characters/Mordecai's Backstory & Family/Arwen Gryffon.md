Arwen is a very obese half-elf, who was first mentioned by [[Cindy]] and is the owner of the [[Nightshade's Crown]] in [[Minatota]]. In his office, there are many pictures of [[Mordecai Reverence]] with his eye cut out. There are many dead [[Tiefling]]s under the pictures, written above them, presumably in their blood "Mordecai stole my heart". 

Arwen is known to have worked with the [[Goblin Mafia]] but it is unknown to what end. He had also kidnapped [[Terence Witherfeather]] and was forcing him to rob the clients of the Nightshade's Crown
