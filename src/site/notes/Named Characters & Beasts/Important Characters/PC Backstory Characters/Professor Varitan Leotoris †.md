### Overview
Leotoris was a professor at [[Strixhaven]], where he taught Magical Theory. He met [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] soon after he started his studies at the University. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time after class together researching theories and managed to greatly increase the world's understanding of magic theory.

### Notable Information
- Leotoris was an incredibly kind man and quickly became a father figure for Chenris after they bonded after class and worked on problems together 
- After some time like this, [[Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was going on a field trip to a local dungeon that [[Strixhaven]] had wrapped nearby to. Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. 
- Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons, he accidentally triggered a trap, but at the last second, Leotoris jumped in and saved him and died in his place.
- With his dying breath, he passed him [[Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said, "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem if it's the last thing you do."
