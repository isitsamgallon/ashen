### Overview
Leotoris was a professor at [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]], where he taught Magical Theory. He met [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] soon after he started his studies at the University. Chenris and Leotoris would spend a lot of time after class together researching theories and managed to greatly increase the world's understanding of magic theory.

After some time like this, [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] was going on a field trip to a local dungeon that [[Locations/Strixhaven\|Strixhaven]] had wrapped to nearby. Having never really been out of the confines of the city, Chenris begged to go on the trip. Leotoris finally relented and snuck his name on the list. Unfortunately, because Chenris was inexperienced with dungeons he accidentally triggered a trap but at the last second Leotoris jumped in and saved him and died in his place. With his dying breath, he passed him [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Leotoris' Last Problem\|Leotoris' Last Problem]] and said "Learn all the secrets of this world and solve this problem, if it's the last thing you do."
