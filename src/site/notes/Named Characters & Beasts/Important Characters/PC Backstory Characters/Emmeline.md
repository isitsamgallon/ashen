### Overview
She is [[The Party/Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]]'s lover from [[Locations/Important Locations & Nations/The Emerald Fort\|The Emerald Fort]]. When they first met, Drache was a part of [[Locations/Important Locations & Nations/The Tulan Fort\|The Tulan Fort]] and would sneak out, abandoning post sometimes, to go see her. 

### Notable Information & History
- For a long time not much was known about her until Drache talked with [[Named Characters & Beasts/Genevieve †\|Genevieve †]] and learned that she was last spotted heading for Tulan, not aware he was in the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]] with [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] at the time.
- In [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 23\|Session 23]], Drache was finally able to free her from Tulan by sneaking into the fort at night. They found her hung upside down in a torture room, beaten and bloodied. 
- Although she had been tortured for possibly a long time, she still had her old sarcastic humour and seemed to be in high spirits. She was shackled with magical cuffs, that required a key to open them so the party left to find the key and free her. However, along the way [[Named Characters & Beasts/Damascus Klyn †\|Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Named Characters & Beasts/Vormomli Bronzehand\|Vormomli Bronzehand]], were spotted heading to the torture chamber and discussing how they wanted to kill her. 
- They sent [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] to investigate but lost contact with the Tiefling soon after and entered themselves to find both Mordecai and Emmeline unconscious on the floor and Klyn waiting for a duel. After a long drawn-out battle, Drache managed to beat his old boss and save both of them.
