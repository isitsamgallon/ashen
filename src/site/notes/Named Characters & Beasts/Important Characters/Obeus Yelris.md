>Obeus is a half-elf and, therefore, is born with some deformities - namely a weak immune system.

### Overview
Obeus Yelris is the daughter of [[Ashira Yelris †]] and [[Caden SteelBreaker †]] and the current Empress of [[Ehobel]]. She is described in books as being a very kind and understanding ruler and has "grand military plans". In reality, she doesn't leave the palace enough to understand what the current situation of her nation is like. 

When [[The Party]] first met her, she had been locked up in the inner sanctum and had never been outside, due to her compromised immune system. The Party had come to propose trade agreements and warn her of the Bandits nearby with [[Grom]]. For the first time being interested in the outside world, she demands that [[The Party]] break her out and take her on an adventure. She has since travelled to many different nations including the [[The War for the OFC's Freedom|OFC]]. [[The Dawn Empire]] and the [[Uvam Dynasty]].

### Personality
Obeus is a quiet and thought girl who is often happy just to experience the world with the party. Although she is highly intelligent, she is also quite innocent of a lot of things people take for granted. For example, when the party first broke her out of the palace in [[Session 16]] she had no idea what she would need to pack and just stuffed her bag with as many books, gold and furniture as she could. 

She is often quick to tears when people accidentally offend her or when people forget to include her in the counts for plans.

### Description
Obeus is a small Elf with sickly pale skin and flowing black hair and can often be found wearing high-quality clothing and carrying some form of book.

### Other Information
- She cried when [[Mordecai Reverence]] said that they would be her friend especially now that they would be travelling together. 
- [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was the only one to understand truly why her guards wouldn't let her leave the palace due to his similar nature as a Half-[[Eladrin]].
- She has been travelling with them as a [[Companions]] since being broken out of the palace.
