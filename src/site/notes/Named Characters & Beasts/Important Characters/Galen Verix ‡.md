### Overview
Galen Verix is the current Emperor of [[The Dawn Empire]], currently residing in [[Dawnhaven]], in a massive palace and a known [[Perpetual]]. He is a distant relative of [[Redmund Verix †]] and like many people in The Dawn, has a particular hatred for [[Elves]] due to the ongoing tensions with [[Ehobel]]. However, if proper etiquette is followed he can show some patience. 

He is particularly renowned as an impressive fighter who fought during [[The Sundering]] as leader of one of the main factions in [[The Coalition]]. This has led to an almost obsessive personality when it comes to stopping any future attempts to bring the Gods and, more importantly, [[Ignatius]] down to [[The Amber Realms]]. It was also revealed that he was incredibly in love with [[Ashira Yelris †]], an affection that was not returned, much to his dismay. 

### Personality
When the party first met Galen, he was a mean, vindictive and incredibly racist man who did not seem to care about the welfare of his citizens or his people as long as he got what he wanted. At times he often came across as obsessive, fixating on blind loyalty and the preservation of [[The Towers]].
