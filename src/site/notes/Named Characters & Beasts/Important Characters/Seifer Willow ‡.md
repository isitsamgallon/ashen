### Overview
One of the chief tacticians for [[Ignatius]] 's army during [[The Sundering]]. She faced off against [[General Midus †]] many times during the way. She was said to be a brutal commander who would sacrifice anything to achieve her lord's goals. At one point, she was said to use massive fiery explosions that destroyed not only [[The Coalition]] 's forces but also her [[Ash Spawn]] forces. She devised a plan to lure [[The Coalition]] forces into a trap. Her [[Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[The Coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy. She was later revealed to be alive inside [[The Crown of the Lost]] on [[Itone Isles]]. She now possesses [[Mordecai Reverence]] after they touch the crown.
