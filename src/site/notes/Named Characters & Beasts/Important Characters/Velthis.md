### Overview
The Arch-Necromancer of [[The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]] and the mastermind beyond the disappearance of [[Dawnhaven]]. He was first encountered in [[Session 25]] when [[The Party]] found thousands of black-robbed cultists performing a complicated spell around the city that involved black tendrils stretching out towards the centre of the city. Velthis was described as being at least 2-3 times more powerful than [[Xekai]] - A mysterious person who was described as being able to easily defeat the whole party. 

Velthis forced the party into entering [[The Dawnhaven Crypts]] and retrieving a crystal he could use for his plans to move Dawnhaven.
