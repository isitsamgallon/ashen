### Overview
A mysterious group that first appeared in [[Session 29]] after the fall of [[The Dawn Empire]]. Initially the party assumed they were aligned with [[Ignatius]] due to their clear flame motif. The group is actually personality cult around [[Kaelis Ignithar]], an ancient and powerful mage.
