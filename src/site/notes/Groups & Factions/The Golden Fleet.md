A fleet of pirates, a very old fleet that owns immeasurable riches. They control the seas and especially the area around [[Snowport]]. The captain of the fleet is known as [[Captain Red Beard]].

The first mentioned near the start of the campaign in [[Session 00]] as a potential way to get out of the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. Then they were later mentioned by the family found in the [[The Black Woods]] and indirectly caused the creation of [[The Ethertwist Haunter]], however they are unaware of this fact.

They made their first appearance when the party attempted to travel to [[Ehobel]] to make a trade deal. One of their members zip lined down from a flying ship, demanding protection money.
