A fleet of pirates, a very old fleet that owns immeasurable riches. They control the seas and especially the area around [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]]. The captain of the fleet is known as [[Named Characters & Beasts/Captain Red Beard\|Captain Red Beard]].

The first mentioned near the start of the campaign in [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 0\|Session 0]] as a potential way to get out of the [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|OFC]]. Then they were later mentioned by the family found in the [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Forest\|The Black Forest]] and indirectly caused the creation of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], however they are unaware of this fact.

They made their first appearance when the party attempted to travel to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ehobel\|Ehobel]] to make a trade deal. One of their members zip lined down from a flying ship, demanding protection money.
