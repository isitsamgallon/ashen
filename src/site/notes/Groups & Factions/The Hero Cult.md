### Overview
When [[The Party]] where travelling through [[Silkhorn]] they found that a man called [[Azel â€ ]] had set up a church and was attempting to stir up racial hatred. They left [[Steve Ulan]] to "deal with the cult" and keep it contained. Wanting to impress them, Steve spent a lot of time forcefully converting people by locking them away and giving them minimal food until they renounced their resisted beliefs. Azel refused to do this and threatened to become violent, leading Steve to kill him. 

This process inadvertently led to the formation of a cult around [[The Party]]. They went as far as to write hymns and sermons to praise [[the party]], much to their dismay. 

### Notable Information 
- One of the main tenets of the cult is to try and follow in the footsteps of [[The Party]] as much as possible by spreading the ideas of tolerance and liberation. 
- The cult sends out missionaries to as many towns and nations as possible to spread their message. Notably, none of the missionaries ever returned from [[Minatota]] and [[Yokotori]], most likely due to them mentioning [[Mordecai Reverence]].
- Most of [[the party]] hates the idea of the cult but ultimately sees it as a force for good since it spreads good values.
- Chenris wanted to move the cult to [[Foxtail Orchards]] to increase trade for the small town.
