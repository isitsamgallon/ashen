[[The Party]] is an official sponsor! The Weatherspoon's of [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. Most of [[The Party]] have Ye Old Tavern Down the Road branded cloaks. Sometimes [[The Party]] will use this to their advantage for disguises, like when [[Mordecai Reverence]] disguised himself as part of the Taverns team that asked people for their opinions in [[The Black Woods]].

Ye Old Tavern Down the Road can allegedly be found in most cities and towns around [[The Amber Realms]], but here is a list of cities they were especially mentioned to be in:
- [[Blackwall]]
- [[Dawnhaven]] 
- [[Ehobel]] - The [[Elves]] know of it and see it as a low-class pub that none of them would want to go to.
