### Overview
The name is given to the group of people that travel with [[The Party]] but don't engage with them day-to-day. They can often be found at a nearby town/ Inn.

### Current Companions
```dataview
TABLE class as "Class", role as "Role", type as "Status"
WHERE role = "Companion"
```

### Notable Information 
- [[James Absolom]] has said that this is because it would be a lot of work to keep track of all of these NPCs and would make fights a lot hard to balance as there would be more characters to fight against.
