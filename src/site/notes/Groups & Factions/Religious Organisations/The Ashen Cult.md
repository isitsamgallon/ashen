The Ashen Cult worships [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]] as the divine flame that must purge the world to make it pure. Its followers embrace destruction as sacred, believing fire cleanses all corruption and prepares the way for rebirth. They await his promised return, spreading his doctrine through scorched earth and fanatical sacrifice.
