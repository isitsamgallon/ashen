### Overview
A well-connected group of goblins that seem to have connections in nearly every nation. They were first encountered in Two Pines when they offered a quest to deliver a "package" to Blackwall, which turned out to be a bomb used to try and blow up [[The Black Tower]]. They turned up various points in the story and a group involved in terrorism, blackmail, thievery, exploitation and presumably much more. 

They could be related to [[Chatiz]] and [[The Goblin Resistance]] from back during [[The Sundering]] but it is unclear if the Goblin Chief is even alive
