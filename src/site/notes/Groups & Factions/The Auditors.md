### Overview
The Auditors, founded by Akin Netch, are an ancient and secretive order dedicated to one sacred mission: to maintain the balance between all forces of the realm—natural and supernatural. Unlike other champions of the age, the Auditors were not bound by morality or personal allegiance. They were answerable to the realm itself, an unshakable force guided by Akin’s wisdom.

Akin saw to it that the Auditors were trained in not only martial skill but also in the subtle arts of diplomacy, espionage, and the manipulation of magic. They were sent into the world with one mandate—to audit and adjust the balance where it was necessary. Whether stopping tyrannical rulers, quelling powerful magical entities, or even tempering the ambitions of would-be heroes, the Auditors operated in the shadows, agents of equilibrium.

Each member of the Auditors has a piece of Akin, binding them to the same mission, a silent brotherhood sworn to uphold balance in all things. Their work would continue for centuries, their actions shaping the realm in ways unseen by common folk.
