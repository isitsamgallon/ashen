The Tower of Ishnmel was one of [[The 5 Towers]] that were constructed after [[The Sundering]] by [[Niaross †]] and [[Ashira Yelris †]]. Found at the centre of [[Ishnmel]], near the palace and the great library it truly a beautiful sight as seemed like the tower had been builtin within a tree and was filled with natural energy.

[[The Towers|The Tower]] is no longer standing due to [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]]'s research going too far as he tried to destroy the crystal found at the top.
