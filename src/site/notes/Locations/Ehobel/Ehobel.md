In reality, She doesn't leave the palace enough to understand the situation of her lands, let alone what i happening with her people. Ehobel was one of the main factions that made up [[Groups/The Coalition\|The Coalition]] during [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. During this period Ehobel had a very good relationship with [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The Dawn Empire\|The Dawn Empire]] after many wars. However, sometime after the Sundering, the nations began to despise each other again, causing [[History & Events/4th Dawn vs Ehobel War\|4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which sprouted the offshoot nation called The [[Locations/OFC/Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)\|Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]].
