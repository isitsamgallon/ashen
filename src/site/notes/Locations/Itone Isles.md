### Overview
A snowy nation found to the north of [[The Dawn Empire]]. The island where [[Uti â€ ]], lives. It is described like the following: "Isolated and inhospitable, [[Itone Isles]] is but a graveyard of a forgotten civilisation, a silent testament to an era lost in the mists of time."

[[The Party]] first travelled here in [[Session 26]].

The island is surrounded by water on all sides and is made up of snowy cliffs and dense fog. Notably, all of the wildlife and nature seem to have died long ago. Everything is covered in this thick layer of snow, however, looking under the snow will reveal thousands of human bones
