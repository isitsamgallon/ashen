Strixhaven is the most prestigious magic academy in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It is both a city and university and fazes in and out of the material plane, reappearing in different locations depending on the academy's needs and interests. The current Headmaster is [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/Haldir Heleyarus\|Haldir Heleyarus]]. Their logo has an emblem of a bird on it, holding a banner. 

The city itself is made up of the residential district and then the university area. The university is made up of many floating islands that float on massive glowing rocks. Each island is linked to the main hall island. Each island then covers a different school of magic that the students can learn from. Either picking one school to specialise in or many. 

[[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is known to have a dark past with the university when his beloved [[Named Characters & Beasts/Important Characters/PC Backstory Characters/Professor Varitan Leotoris †\|Professor Varitan Leotoris †]] sacrificed himself to save chenris in a dungeon field trip. This act ultimately led to chenris being banned from the university.
