A huge black tower located at the back of the back of the city and is where the majority of the cities knowledge, decision making and leaders is located. According to a [[Unnamed Book on the History of The Black Tower|book found in the restricted section of the library]], the tower was built back during the [[Grayfall Empire]]. Due to the uprising of their human slaves in the [[4th Era]] the tower was remodelled to hold many secret passage ways to allow them to escape at a moments notice. These passages ways were then later used by the Dwarves of [[Fort Moldan]] to rob the tower of all its riches while [[The Party]] was away.
