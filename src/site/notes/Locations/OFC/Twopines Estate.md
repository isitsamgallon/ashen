The estate of the Duke of Twopines. [[The Party]] first travelled here in response to a quest from the [[Adventurers Guild]] about the Duke's missing daughter. In reality, his daughter was already dead and had been taken by [[The Ethertwist Haunter]]. This is the village that started the quest to stop [[The Ethertwist Haunter]]. [[The Party]] did have a chance to get her back, but they would've had to sacrifice some of their life span, which just isn't an option for most of [[The Party]].
