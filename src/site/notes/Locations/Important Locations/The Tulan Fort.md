A mercenary fort that used to be led by [[Damascus Klyn †]] and is the rival to [[The Emerald Fort]]. It is located towards the southern end of the [[Verdant Spine]]. There is a secret tunnel going through the mountain range that connects to [[Yakawa]] that [[Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] used to meet his lover, [[Emmeline]] secretly. It was noted that its main fighting force is treated incredibly poorly compared to its rival, with armour that is one size fits all and tents to sleep in rather than barracks. It notably sided with [[The Dawn Empire]] during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. It was also part of [[The Coalition]] during [[The Sundering]], however, this was under different leadership.
