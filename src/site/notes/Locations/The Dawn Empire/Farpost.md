A small town in [[The Dawn Empire]] seems to have been taken over by the military as part of the preparations during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. It is mostly made up of Military tents and temporary settlements. [[Commander Arez â€ ]] was in charge of this Farpost until he was given word to march on the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]].
