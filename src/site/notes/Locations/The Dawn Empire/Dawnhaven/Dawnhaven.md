### Overview
Dawnhaven is the capital city of [[The Dawn Empire]] and the residence of Emperor Galen Verix. The city appears prosperous, featuring well-constructed and attractive buildings. However, as [[The Party]] ventures off the main streets, the disparity in wealth becomes increasingly apparent.

Dawnhaven is situated at the northwesternmost point of [[The Dawn Empire]]. However, it disappeared at the end of [[Session 25]] due to an incredibly complex spell cast by [[Velthis]] and [[The Necromantic Circle of Dawnhaven]]. Its current location remains unknown.
