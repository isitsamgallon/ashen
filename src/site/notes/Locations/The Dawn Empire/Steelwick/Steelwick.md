Steelwick is the home city of [[Steve Ulan]] and is found a little ways from [[The Dawn Empire]]'s boarder. Steelwick is an old mining town adorned with dark and spruce wood building and decorated with precious metals. Steelwick's mines are also home to secret [[Iron Forge| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] found behind a set of heavy door ([[Session 03]]). The city ended up hiring the services of [[Strixhaven]] to investigate the dungeon further. 

[[The Party]] was then hired as guards for the [[Strixhaven]] researchers to explore this dungeon, leading to the discovery of a small ancient Dwarven city with insane amount of history. [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]] managed to find multiple documents that describe some of the history of the settlement including the fact that it was used during a previous war with the humans.
