### Overview
A plaque found to the south of  [[The Dawn Empire]] and near [[Old Earthgrog]]. This was a farming village [[The Party]] first visited in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38]]. Notably, [[The Party]] and a large group of nobel [[Vampire]] s destroyed all of the town's food supplies when [[Halfbie]] was infected by the [[Fragment Of Vaelrith]]. 

The [[Vampire]] s promised to donate food and mopney to the village, [[The Party]] is currently unsure if they followed through with this promise.
