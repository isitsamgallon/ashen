Cliffhall is a small town found to the west of [[The Dawn Empire]]. The town was relatively unremarkable, however, when [[The Party]] first visited they learnt that it was actually being haunted by the [[Angel Under The Well]]. A [[Herald]] of [[Somnora]] that had the ability to change people's memories or interrupt their sleep. This led to various people going missing or the guards having no energy to perform their duties.
