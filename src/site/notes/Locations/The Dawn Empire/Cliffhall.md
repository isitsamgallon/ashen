The town was relatively unremarkable, however, when [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] first visited they learnt that it was actually being haunted by the [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Angel Under The Well\|Angel Under The Well]]. A [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]] that had the ability to change people's memories or interrupt their sleep.
