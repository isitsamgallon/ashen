### Other Information 
Most tables are actually database query searches and will automatically update when new information is added. DM [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] if you have any suggestions on possible searches.

As always, you should talk to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] if you have any ideas or thoughts relating to the campaign. **NEVER** keep secrets from the DM. This is a collaborative storytelling game, and it only works well if the storyteller knows what's happening. They might even be able to make it happen better than you expected.
