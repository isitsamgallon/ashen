This is a read-only version of the Ashen Campaign Vault, designed to make it easier to find, read, and share campaign information without having to set up Obsidian. Although not built for theorising, you can find a list of our current **[[Other Information/Theories & Unanswered Questions\|THEORIES & UNANSWERED QUESTIONS HERE]]**.

I have compiled a small list of common notes people might want to read below but there is also a search function on both desktop and mobile. On the desktop, there is also an "Explorer" section which contains the full folder tree of the vault to make finding specific notes easier.  

I plan to update this every month or if any major changes/ information is learned after a session. DM [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] if there are any problems. As always, you should talk to [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/James Absolom\|James Absolom]] if you have any ideas or thoughts relating to the campaign. **NEVER** keep secrets from the DM this is a collaborative storytelling game, and it only works well if the storyteller knows what's happening. Who knows, they might even be able to make it happen better than you expected. 

> [!tip] Useful Tip - Daggers
> † denotes that this character is dead.
> 
> ‡ denotes that the circumstances around this character's death are strange or unusual.
> 
> We have made a point of never officially putting daggers on people unless we are outright told by James or in an official text.
