# Purpose & Use:
This is a read-only version of the Ashen Campaign Vault to make it easier to find, read and share campaign information without having to set up Obsidian.

I have compiled a small list of common notes people might want to read below but there is also a search function on both desktop and mobile. On the desktop, there is also an "Explorer" section which contains the full folder tree of the vault to make finding specific notes easier.  

I plan to update this every month or if any major changes/ information is learned after a session. DM [[The Party/Other Party Members/Meta/Sam Gallon\|Sam Gallon]] if there are any problems.
