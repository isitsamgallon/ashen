This was an ancient ritual that could be used to banish [[The Ethertwist Haunter]]. To perform this ritual, the afflicted must burn 8 of [[The Pages]] along with their most prized possession. Everyone must then close their eyes and not open them until they hear three rings of a bell. 

Here is a list of what each party member burnt during their ritual:
- [[Aiden Knight]] threw in the key that he had used to escape the cult he had been holding since his birth. 
- [[The Korrigan]] Placed a worn-out short sword offering it to [[Sera]] and stepped back, tears littering his face. 
- [[Mordecai Reverence]] burnt [[Claribelle Reverence †]]'s cloak.
- [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] puts a hastily written note with an unsolved problem. (This is a fake and will ultimately cause the ritual to fail)
- [[Wurinn Fuuldrusch]] Ripped [[The Emerald Fort]] emblem from this shirt, kissing it and determined that he would find who he was missing.

[[The Party]] originally discovered the ritual during a raid on [[The Black Cult]]. where they found a book on the subject in the cults library ([[Page From Unnamed Book found the Black Cult's Hideout]]).
