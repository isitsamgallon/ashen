### Overview
**The Temporal Harbinger, Bringer of Chaos.** Although he dedicates most of his time to using his powers to sow chaos across [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] for his own amusement, he is also responsible for maintaining the flow of time and keeping it moving forward at the correct speed. He often makes pacts with mortals, with his most common pact being to take parts of their lifespans in exchange for help with a problem or strength. He often appears in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], choosing to take the form of a cloud of black smoke with nothing but a creepy smile levitating in it, halting time when he does appear. He also causes time rifts to open across the Amber Realm, which bleeds time, causing chaos and agony wherever they appear. 

He has devotees in the form of [[Groups & Factions/Religious Organisations/The Black Cult\|The Black Cult]] who perform sacrifices on random people and give their remaining lifespans to the God. He has a few heralds who help to spread his influence, though his main one is [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|The Ethertwist Haunter]], who takes children and drains them of their remaining years to give to Chronovorus. He presides over [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Forest\|The Black Forest]], where he spends a lot of his time watching the realms and waiting for the end of time.

| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | The forest fire slowed unnaturally, frozen in time as [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] watched in awe and confusion. When Kal’s attempts to interact with the suspended flames failed, shattering his dagger upon contact, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] ’s alarm grew. A mysterious figure emerged from the haze, manipulating the stillness around them with intricate gestures. Introducing himself as Aiden, he revealed his ability to close temporal distortions, which were caused by the chaos-bringing deity [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]]. Though he provided little detail, Aiden joined [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] on their journey to Two Pines Estate, his enigmatic presence adding to the tension of their travels.                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] then travelled to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], a sprawling city dominated by the imposing Black Tower. They split up, with Chenris, Mordecai, and Aiden seeking answers in the tower’s grand library while Kal and Drache delivered a mysterious package from Foxtail Orchard. Chenris uncovered information about [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Ethertwist Haunter\|the Ethertwist Haunter]], a [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|herald]] of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] with the power to manipulate time and erase memories. Meanwhile, Kal fell victim to a goblin trap and was turned into a magically compelled suicide bomber. With no way to stop Kal’s march toward [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/The Black Tower\|the Black Tower]], [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] himself appeared, offering to resolve the crisis for 25 years of their lives.                                                                                                  |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Chenris rejected the offer and disappeared, finding himself in the presence of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Goddess of Light and Knowledge. She offered him the means to dispel the ancient goblin magic in exchange for a portion of his magical abilities. Accepting the deal, Chenris returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], dispelling the magic and saving Kal. [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], amused and intrigued by the group, warned them that the cost of retrieving the missing child would rise with each passing day. With their encounter resolved, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] regrouped, the weight of Chenris’ decision and the looming threat of the gods shaping their next steps as they prepared to delve deeper into their perilous journey.                                                                                        |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]] | Their quest for the ritual pages took them repeatedly into [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/The Black Forest\|the Black Forest]], each time arriving at a clearing with a house in various stages of decay. Each mission brought them closer to the house's original state, revealing more of its history and its occupants’ tragic past. On their second-to-last mission, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] encountered a man building a home alongside his pregnant wife and child. The man recounted a harrowing tale of leaving [[Locations/Snowport\|Snowport]] and making a deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] to survive a treacherous sea journey. In exchange for safe passage, the god claimed their second-born child, an act that still haunted the family. [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The party]] acquired the page but left in stunned silence, burdened by the cruelty of the god and the suffering he inflicted. |
