>"AND FROM THE BREACH IN THE FABRIC OF TIME came the Chronovorus, the Eater of Days, whose form was not fixed, and whose hunger knew no end. He passed unseen through ages, devouring what was and what might be, until even memory turned to dust." <cite> [[Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Chronovorus is a shifting, formless being born of Broken time, a presence that slips through cracks in Causality and memory. It does not speak, only consumes - Eras, events, and identities vanishing in its wake. To Witness it is to feel moments unravel, as if the world Itself forgets its own story. It does not hunger out of Malice, but simply because it exists where time no Longer holds meaning.

### General Information
**The Temporal Harbinger, Bringer of Chaos.** Although he dedicates most of his time to using his powers to sow chaos across [[The Amber Realms]] for his own amusement, he is also responsible for maintaining the flow of time and keeping it moving forward at the correct speed. He often makes pacts with mortals, with his most common pact being to take parts of their lifespans in exchange for help with a problem or strength. He often appears in [[The Amber Realms]], choosing to take the form of a cloud of black smoke with nothing but a creepy smile levitating in it, halting time when he does appear. He also causes time rifts to open across the Amber Realm, which bleeds time, causing chaos and agony wherever they appear. 

He has devotees in the form of [[The Black Cult]] who perform sacrifices on random people and give their remaining lifespans to the God. He has a few heralds who help to spread his influence, though his main one is [[The Ethertwist Haunter]], who takes children and drains them of their remaining years to give to Chronovorus. He presides over [[The Black Woods]], where he spends a lot of his time watching the realms and waiting for the end of time.

### Divine Attributes
- Chronovorus rules over the volatile domains of Time, Chaos, Destruction, Entropy, and Manipulation. He Embodies the inevitable decay of all things and the Unravelling of order, where time fractures and spirals Into uncertainty, and nothing remains fixed for long. 
- His symbols are a shattered hourglass bleeding away Time, a spiral fractal hinting at infinite, chaotic paths, And a clock face stripped of its hands- a chilling Emblem of time unbound. 
- The sacred colours of his worship are black, dark Violet, and shimmering silver: black for the void Between moments, violet for the turbulence of Disorder, and silver for the glint of unrealized Potential.
- Creatures sacred to him include ethereal serpents That slip through time's current, and shadow crows Whose presence heralds disruption, decay, and the Slow collapse of reality.

### Mythos & Legends
Chronovorus, god of Time, Chaos, and Entropy, is a Divine paradox-born not of destruction, but of Compassion. From the heart of [[Seraphina]], goddess of Mercy and Fate, he was brought into being during a Moment of cosmic sorrow, forged from her silent grief
At witnessing the unchanging suffering of mortals. In Seeking to ease their burdens, she birthed time itself only To find that its flow could not be contained. Thus, Chronovorus emerged: a god who saw not the mercy in Order, but the freedom in unravelling.

From his first breath, he was captivated by time's wild Beauty, choosing to sever it from predictability and turn It into a force of disruption. To Chronovorus, time is a Canvas best left unfinished, full of potential when Unbound. He exists to twist, to tangle, and to remind
Creation that nothing is eternal-not even the gods.

One legend recounts how he fractured the timeline of a Once-great empire. With a thought, he opened temporal Rifts across their lands-aging cities into dust while Others regressed to their dawn. The empire collapsed in Confusion, its people splintered into rival ages, unable to Recognize kin or cause. Today, their broken remnants Still shimmer across time, caught in cycles they cannot Escape.

A tale told with both awe and warning is that of the Emerald Swan, an artifact created by a mortal sorcerer Who begged Chronovorus for eternal life. Amused, the God granted his wish-but bound the man's lifespan to Those around him. Though long-lived, each bearer
Suffered cruel and ironic ends, their longevity a hollow Curse. In this, Chronovorus revealed his truth: time is a Gift best left unasked for.

His relationship with his sister, [[Aeloria]], goddess of Light and Knowledge, is one of eternal opposition. Where she seeks to preserve and illuminate, he seeks to Obscure and undo. Their divine conflict is written into The bones of the world- into the rise and fall of empires,
The flicker of stars, and the split-second choices that Shape mortal fate.

Yet Chronovorus is not evil- only inevitable. He is the Reminder that all things change, that endings come, and That from every unravelling, something strange and new Might emerge. Born of mercy, he became chaos Incarnate- and in his wake, the world continues to turn.
