> "AND LORWYN DANCED UPON THE WIND, VEILED IN Purple and crowned with madness, the jester-Queen of Shadows. Her laughter confounded kings and prophets Alike, for she spoke in riddles and cloaked the truth in Illusion, that the wise might stumble and the fool see Clearly.""<cite> [[Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Lorwyn is a trickster cloaked in illusion and crowned in Laughter, dancing on the edge of dreams and madness. She wears royalty like a costume and truth like a riddle, Reshaping reality with a flick of her fingers. To know her Is to question what is real - not because she lies, but Because she shows how fragile certainty can be. She is Chaos wrapped in beauty, and beauty wrapped in a joke No one fully understands.

### General Information
She rules over the [[Feywild]] s and the Fey creatures that inhabit that realm. For the longest time, she had no known [[Herald]], until it was revealed that [[The Korrigan]] had become one. When [[Kal โก]] died in [[Session 02]] he made a deal with her. 

In exchange for a return to life infused with fey magic, Kal's memories would be wiped clean upon re-entering the material plane, and he would emerge as [[The Korrigan|Korrigan]] the [[herald]] of Lorwyn, However, there was a condition: after Kal had finished his unfinished business, he would then have to destroy the Divine Pillar in [[lost haven]].

[[The Korrigan|Korrigan]] seems to be aware of Lorwyn's intentions.


### Divine Attributes
- Lorwyn is the wild heart of Nature touched by Deception, Chaos, Trickery, and Change. Ever shifting and untamed, they delight in misdirection and transformation, blurring the line between what is real and what is imagined, all in playful service to deeper, hidden truths. 
- Their symbols are as elusive as their nature: a crescent moon surrounded by flickering fireflies, a fox mask concealing laughter and cunning, and an oak leaf caught in a swirl of wind- each a reflection of whimsy and unpredictability.
- The sacred colors of their worship are green, gold, and twilight purple- green for nature's ever-turning cycle, gold for cleverness and allure, and purple for the mystery that hides between dusk and dream. 
- Fey creatures are most sacred to Lorwyn: mischievous sprites that stir up harmless chaos, sly fox-spirits who dance at the edge of illusion, and serene, deer-like fey whose quiet presence masks ancient and subtle magic.

### Mythos & Legends
Lorwyn, goddess of Trickery, Change, and the Fey, is a being of whimsy and contradiction-both revered and feared as the ever-shifting spirit of mischief. Born of wild places and half-spoken dreams, she dances at the edges of order, reshaping the world not through force,
but through cleverness, illusion, and a well-timed laugh. To worship Lorwyn is to embrace the unexpected, to find meaning in chaos, and to trust that even the crooked path may lead to beauty.

The Trickster's Dance is one of the oldest and most beloved tales told in her name. In it, Lorwyn lures gods and mortals alike into a game of riddles played over a blighted land. Through deceit, laughter, and misdirection, she transforms a cursed and barren region into a thriving forest-proving that her chaos is not destruction, but wild, creative rebirth. She is a disruptor, yes, but also a healer in disguise.

Mortals who encounter her often find themselves entangled in strange and binding pacts, receiving gifts of power, transformation, or fate itself-always given with terms that reveal their full meaning only when it's too late to turn back. One enduring legend tells of a queen
who asked for eternal prosperity for her people. Lorwyn granted it-but in doing so, reshaped the land so wildly that the people no longer recognized their home, nor the
ruler who made the deal. Such stories reveal her gifts as double-edged: generous, but never without price.

Lorwyn is also the undisputed guardian of the [[Feywild]], a realm as fluid and unpredictable as she is. During the cataclysmic Sundering, when the boundaries of the planes threatened to shatter, it was her illusions, tricks, and shifting terrain that shielded countless fey from
annihilation. Her laughter became their shield, her riddles their s alvation.

To serve Lorwyn is to let go of certainty and embrace the dance of change. She is the rustle in the leaves, the sudden shift in wind, the smile you didn't expect. In her realm, truth wears a mask- and sometimes, the mask tells more than the face beneath.
