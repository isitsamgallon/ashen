The Fey Sovereign, Supreme Trickster. She is a mysterious god who seems to act purely for her own entertainment. She rules over the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]s and the Fey creatures that inhabit that realm. For the longest time, she had no known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], until it was revealed that [[The Party/The Korrigan/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] had become one. When Korrigan died in [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 2\|Session 2]] he made a deal with her. 

In exchange for a return to life infused with fey magic, Kal's memories would be wiped clean upon re-entering the material plane, and he would emerge as Korrigan the herald of Lorwyn, However, there was a condition: after Kal had finished his unfinished business, he would then have to destroy the Divine Pillar in lost haven.

Korrigan seems to be aware of Lorwyn's intentions.
