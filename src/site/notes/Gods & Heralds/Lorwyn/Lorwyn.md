### Overview
The Fey Sovereign, Supreme Trickster. She is a mysterious god who seems to act purely for her own entertainment. She rules over the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] s and the Fey creatures that inhabit that realm. For the longest time, she had no known [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], until it was revealed that [[The Party/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] had become one. When [[The Party/Dead/Kal ‡\|Kal ‡]] died in [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 02\|Session 02]] he made a deal with her. 

In exchange for a return to life infused with fey magic, Kal's memories would be wiped clean upon re-entering the material plane, and he would emerge as Korrigan the herald of Lorwyn, However, there was a condition: after Kal had finished his unfinished business, he would then have to destroy the Divine Pillar in lost haven.

Korrigan seems to be aware of Lorwyn's intentions.

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | "Do you know [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]?" he asked, nodding to Sylvia, "Well, I died in a fight with a Wyvern, and now [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] has a new [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]].  AND LOOK, NOW I HAVE HORNS."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | Before the rest of [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] could firmly reject the idea based on past experiences, Sylvia agreed with a smirk, and they both disappeared. When Sylvia opened her eyes, she found herself in a quiet part of a meadow where he once made his deal with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]]. He invited her to sit down and admire the view of the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywilds]]. She sat down, amazed by its untamed beauty. After a few moments, she turned to him, and with a coy smile, she asked, "We're you really that desperate to get some alone time with me?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | "Yeah, I appeared here, and [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] came up to me, and we made a deal", Kerrigan explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 37\|Session 37]]              | "I ask because I can't remember. Part of my deal involved unfinished business at [[Locations/Important Locations/Lost Haven\|Lost Haven]]. I made the deal to go back and finish that unfinished business I've lost. In return, I am [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], and I do some really funny stuff - like, did you see the horse?! Its always angry and wants to eat [[Other Information/Races/Human\|Human]] and i can summon it!!" explained [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] excitedly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 05\|Session 05]] | The tome told of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], the Primordial Divinity, whose death had given birth to gods and mortals alike. Fragments of [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] ’s soul had formed the gods, while his body had fractured into countless beings, encasing themselves in shells that became the planets. [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], the being imprisoned within their world, was one such entity, its power harnessed by the Divine Pillars to ward off the gods and maintain balance. Korrigan’s hands trembled as he read that severing the magical link between [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]] and [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Towers\|the pillars]] would free the creature. The revelation was staggering, intertwining with his pact with [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]], the Fey Sovereign, who had tasked him with seeking this very knowledge. Returning the book to its place, Korrigan departed the library, his thoughts weighed down by the implications of what he had learned. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | As the group gets to [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Steelwick/Steelwick\|Steelwick]] they hear a Familiar voice asking the party for any food. They turn to face the character and the person looks and sounds exactly like Kal but this person has antlers. He calls himself Korrigan and has amnesia. The group takes him in more out of curiosity (Chenris keep trying to securely study him).  Mordecai then scare Korrigans  into using his abilities to learn more about him and his abilities. [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] 's name comes up a lot when talking about his powers, he even has Kal's Bow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 03\|Session 03]] | Trying to figure and what the hell is going on with korrigan. They decide that they are next going to the library to read what they can on [[Gods & Heralds/Lorwyn/Lorwyn\|Lorwyn]] - it is revealed that she is a deity and might've had a hand in whatever is going on with Korrigan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
