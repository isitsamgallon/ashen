**The Verdant Arbiter, Bringer of Balance**. The God responsible for ensuring the world keeps spinning and that all things remain as they should. While his dominion may seem similar to that of [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], who governs time, the crucial difference is that Eldros oversees everything—life, death, decay, growth, prosperity, and famine. His divine role is to maintain the natural order of the world, ensuring that each of these fundamental aspects continues in harmony.

When Eldros manifests, he often appears as a juggler spinning multiple plates, each representing a vital force of existence. If any of these plates falter, it is his duty to set them spinning again, preventing imbalance. Originally, Eldros also oversaw the realm of dreams, but due to the unpredictable nature of that domain, he found it difficult to maintain alongside the waking world. To resolve this, he created his daughter, [[Gods & Heralds/Somnora/Somnora\|Somnora]], entrusting her with the governance of dreams so he could focus solely on reality.

Despite holding dominion over life and death, Eldros cannot kill a god, as deities exist beyond the natural order he controls. The priest at [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/The All-Father Temple\|The All-Father Temple]] explaining this concept clarifies that gods typically reside in their own domains, making them immune to each other’s influence. Even when they manifest in the mortal world, they do so as mere aspects of themselves, meaning that destroying such an aspect does not harm the true god. Additionally, Eldros is unique among the gods in that he has no known Heralds to act as his intermediaries.
