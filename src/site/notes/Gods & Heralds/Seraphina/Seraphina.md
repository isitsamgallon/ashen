### Overview
**The Compassionate One, Bringer of Health**. Although there is no distinction between the moral standing of the deities, she often considered the closet to being a 'moral good' God. It seems she has temples in most major cities that can be used to access healing. 

Each of her temples has a [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]], which also acts as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], that provides all the healing for the people in place of Seraphina since she is unable to enter [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was revealed early on that Seraphina hates [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]].

# Known Temple Locations:
- [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]
- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | The two big Rizzmeisters (Korrigan and Mordecai) drag Drache to the temple to ask for her help in fixing him. Seraphina says that it interferes too much for her to do so but fixes Mordecais killer hangover. Korrigan then remembers the celestial phrase that Terrance Witherfeather used when he freed Korrigan from the ivory Crest years ago and found that it kinda put Drache into stasis. |
