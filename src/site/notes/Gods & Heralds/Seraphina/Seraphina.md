The Compassionate One, Bringer of Health. Although there is no distinction between the moral standing of the deities, she often considered the closet to being a 'moral good' God. It seems she has temples in most major cities that can be used to access healing. 

Each of her temples has a [[Gods & Heralds/Seraphina/Healing Guardian\|Healing Guardian]], which also acts as her [[Gods & Heralds/Herald\|Herald]], that provides all the healing for the people in place of Seraphina since she is unable to enter [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]]. It was revealed early on that Seraphina hates [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]].

# Known Temple Locations:
- [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]]
- [[Locations/The Dawn Empire/Dawnhaven/Dawnhaven\|Dawnhaven]]
