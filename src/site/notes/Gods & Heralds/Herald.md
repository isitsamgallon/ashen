There are two main theories on how heralds are made, either they are people who accomplish great feats in their lives and thus are chosen by gods to carry out their whims. The second way is where a small part of the god is given form to go to [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] to carry out the Gods whims. You usually have to willingly accept to become a herald.

It's very unlikely anyone who fought in [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]] became a herald because of the following: 
- These people know the power of Heralds and Gods and how dangerous they are 
- They wouldn't be chosen by any Gods as they helped build [[Admin/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] which weakened all god's abilities
