Ignatius is known as The Cleansing Flame, Destroyer of worlds, the god of war. Ignatius is best known for when he entered [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] to 'purify' the world in an event known as [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]]. 

He is famously worshipped by [[Groups/Religious Organisations/The Ashen Cult\|The Ashen Cult]] (known in the modern day as [[Groups/Religious Organisations/The Red Cult\|The Red Cult]]), which was led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/The Sundering Characters/High Priest Lyrion\|High Priest Lyrion]], he was brought into the world and immediately started to make preparations to begin war. This included making the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Firesoul Greatsword\|Firesoul Greatsword]], which could reduce anyone it slashed to ash and reform them as part of the [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ash Spawn\|Ash Spawn]] army. 

It is said in [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult\|The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] that [[Locations/The Desert/Ember Peak\|Ember Peak]], are large volcano found in [[Locations/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] was "as a conduit to [[Gods & Heralds/Ignatius/Ignatius\|Ignatius]]. Its molten heart pulsed with the essence of their god, and its fiery eruptions were seen as omens of his imminent return."

### What Faith Means to the Moderates
The moderates of the faction believe Ignatius will come down and wipe away the bad and give way for good just without so much senseless pain or killing. [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Ignatius's Room\|The priest]] gives the example of the [[History & Events/Grayfall Empire\|Grayfall Empire]] and the humans, the Dwarves were all slave owners and treated everyone horribly. The humans, led by [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Grayfall Empire Characters/Redmund Verix †\|Redmund Verix †]] rose using violence to earn their freedom. e.i. a bad system was replaced by a better one. Another example is the OFC, there is a large war with humungous loss of life on both sides and yet the OFC is a pillar of freedom and equality.

### What Faith Means to the Extremists 
The extremists believe that Ignatius will come down to destroy all evil in the world and make way for good to come take its place. This often comes in the form of mass slaughter and destruction.
