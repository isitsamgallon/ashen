His arrival in the mortal realm is not considered A descent, but an eruption-an inevitable blaze foretold In smoke and scripture.

The Prophecy of [[the Cleansing]] Flame, whispered Through generations by [[the Ashen Cult]], foretold his Coming. It spoke of a god who would descend not in Mercy, but in judgment, wielding fire to purge Corruption and sin. The prophecy came to pass with the Shattering of the [[Skyfall Ward]], a divine barrier once Shielding the mortal realm from direct godly Intervention. When it broke, the world trembled, and Ignatius walked through.
