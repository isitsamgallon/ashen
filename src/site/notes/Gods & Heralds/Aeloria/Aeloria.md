> "AND LO, AELORIA CAME FORTH CLOAKED IN radiant light, the Keeper of Knowledge, whose eyes beheld the secrets of the firmament. Around her did the holy tomes revolve, and her voice was as a thousand whispers of truth, guiding the faithful and forbidding the unworthy. " <cite> [[Nehzahr]] </cite>

### Overview
Aeloria is a radiant, near-divine being who embodies the pursuit of understanding and the quiet power of truth. She appears as a serene, luminous figure surrounded by drifting books and soft light, moving through the world not as a conqueror, but as a guide. She exists in the spaces between thought and revelation, drawn to those who seek meaning, and offering glimpses of clarity to those willing to listen. 

### General Information
Living in [[The Golden Plane|her grand library]]. She dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. She has no physical form in [[The Amber Realms]], however, she often pulls people up to The Golden Plain to communicate with her directly, where she chooses to take the form of an elven woman wearing all white. 

She has a group of followers known as [[The Golden Ones]] who sign a pact with her on initiation, meaning that she gets their eternal soul to act as a researcher while they get whatever knowledge they may require.

Aeloria is seen as generally a good god who dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. However, she can also be quite cruel in what she asks for in return for knowledge, like when [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[Mordecai Reverence]] visit her room in the [[Session 20#Aeloria's Room|All-Father Temple]].

### Divine Attributes
 - Aeloria reigns over the divine domains of Light, Knowledge, Hope, and Enlightenment, each facet reflecting her eternal role as the guide of minds and the bearer of sacred truth. Her presence inspires clarity where there was once confusion, and warmth where there was despair.
 - Her symbol is a radiant sunburst cradling an open book at its heart, often accompanied by a golden quill encircled by a halo of light - emblems of revelation, learning, and divine inspiration made manifest.
 - The sacred colors of her worship are gold, white, and soft azure: gold for divine wisdom, white for purity of purpose, and azure for the serene depths of understanding.
 - Creatures held dear to her are the golden dove, a messenger of hope; the white stag, a silent guardian and beacon of guidance; and the luminous moth, ever-drawn to the light of hidden truths, fluttering at the threshold between ignorance and knowing.

### Mythos & legend
Aeloria is revered as the divine spark that illuminates shadowed minds and lost paths. She was born from [[Seraphina]] during an age when mortals cried out not only for healing, but for understanding. In answer to their pleas, [[Seraphina]] wept tears of starlight-tears that became Aeloria, a being of radiant insight. Where her brother [[Chronovorus]] would later embody the chaos of time, Aeloria arose as its guide, bringing order to its flow and meaning to its moments. 

She is the eternal teacher, the bearer of sacred truth, and the light at the edge of the unknown. Among her most beloved myths is the tale of an exiled tribe lost in a barren land. With no map but the stars above, it was Aeloria who came to them in silence, teaching them to read the night sky. Through her wisdom, they transformed desolation into abundance, and despair into purpose-a testament to her gift of knowledge as salvation. 

But Aeloria's light does not go unchallenged. Her twin in divine opposition is [[Chronovorus]], her brother and rival, whose birth mirrored hers in timing but not in spirit. While she preserves, he unravels; while she brings clarity, he sows uncertainty. Their struggle echoes across [[the Amber Realms]], influencing the fate of empires and the choices of mortals. It is said that whenever a great discovery is made, or a great lie exposed, their silent battle flares anew. 

Her most devoted followers, [[The Golden Ones]], enter into a sacred pact-granted boundless knowledge in life, they pledge their eternal souls to her after death. In the radiant halls of [[The Golden Plane]], they become eternal scholars, uncovering the truths of the cosmos within her celestial library. Yet even here, caution is whispered: one tale tells of a scholar who reached too far, unearthing forbidden knowledge and becoming lost in endless research, burdened by truths never meant for mortal minds. 

Aeloria is not merely a goddess of learning-she is its light. She does not demand worship, but invites seekers. In her presence, confusion gives way to clarity, and ignorance to revelation. And through her, the eternal question becomes a path, lit gently by stars.
