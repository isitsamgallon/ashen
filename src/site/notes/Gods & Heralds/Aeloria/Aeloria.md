### Overview
**The Goddess of Light, Bringer of Knowledge**, who lives in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria's Library\|her grand library]]. She dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. She has no physical form in [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]], however, she often pulls people up to The Golden Plain to communicate with her directly, where she chooses to take the form of an elven woman wearing all white. 

She has a group of followers known as [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/The Golden Ones\|The Golden Ones]] who sign a pact with her on initiation, meaning that she gets their eternal soul to act as a researcher while they get whatever knowledge they may require.

Aeloria is seen as generally a good god who dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Amber Realms\|The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. However, she can also be quite cruel in what she asks for in return for knowledge, like when [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] visit her room in the [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 20#Aeloria's Room\|All-Father Temple]].

| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 09\|Session 09]] | When the party opens their eyes they are in [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] 's library and there is a soul for each member of the party except Chenris. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] states that she will help the party get stronger ([[Level Up\|Level Up]]) as she is a fan of how much information she is getting out of the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Season 2 - The War for The OFC's Freedom/Session 06\|Session 06]] | Chenris and Aidan went to Aeloria’s temple and Chenris was offered the exact location of the wizard in exchange for him not remembering where he was from. Chenris renegotiated with the Goddess for a more general location of where Terrance was in exchange for his knowledge of his family home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Chenris remained silent as they pressed onward, his mind burdened by fragmented memories of his dream and the haunting revelations it had uncovered. [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] ’s words echoed in his thoughts, cutting deeper than any wound from the goblins. Mordecai, ever attuned to the emotional undercurrents around him, kept a watchful eye on the elf, refraining from prying but ready to offer his irreverent support when needed. Meanwhile, Drache’s steadfast presence provided a sense of stability to the group, even as his stern admonishments reminded them of the dangers of carelessness in their chaotic lives.                                                                                      |
| [[Session Notes/Season 1 - Echoes of the Ethertwist/Session 00\|Session 00]]      | Chenris rejected the offer and disappeared, finding himself in the presence of [[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]], the Goddess of Light and Knowledge. She offered him the means to dispel the ancient goblin magic in exchange for a portion of his magical abilities. Accepting the deal, Chenris returned to [[Locations/OFC/Blackwall/Blackwall\|Blackwall]], dispelling the magic and saving Kal. [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]], amused and intrigued by the group, warned them that the cost of retrieving the missing child would rise with each passing day. With their encounter resolved, [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|the party]] regrouped, the weight of Chenris’ decision and the looming threat of the gods shaping their next steps as they prepared to delve deeper into their perilous journey. |
