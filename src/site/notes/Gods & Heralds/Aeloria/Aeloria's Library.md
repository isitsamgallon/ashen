### Overview
[[Gods & Heralds/Aeloria/Aeloria\|Aeloria]] 's Library is an otherworldly repository of knowledge suspended between realms. It is not a single building but rather an ever-shifting labyrinth of interconnected chambers, each uniquely designed to house a particular type of wisdom or magic.

### Description
The library is impossibly big and houses an untold number of books and ancient wisdoms. The air hums faintly with arcane energy, carrying the faint scent of aged parchment, ink, and a hint of ozone. The light is soft and golden, emanating from floating orbs that drift lazily through the chambers, casting no shadows.

Despite its serene beauty, the library exudes an unsettling aura. Whispers drift through the halls, indistinct murmurs of ancient scholars, forgotten memories, and perhaps the library itself. The whispers seem to respond to the thoughts of the visitors as if the library is alive and aware of their presence.

The shelves themselves defy mortal understanding. Some are impossibly tall, extending upward into ceilings that fade into a starry void. Others are compact and intimate, shaped like spirals or crescents, encouraging personal discovery. There are sections where books float freely, orbiting around glowing pedestals, while others are stacked neatly in glass cases that open only at the touch of the worthy.

### Notable Information
