The Primordial Divinity. In the beginning, there was one being. Aetherion, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The All-Father\|The All-Father]]. when he died, his body split off becoming eggs. These eggs hatched into huge beings. The soul of Aetherion split up into different beings in accordance with his emotions. (Anger, Sadness, Hatred, Compassion, etc) and they become [[Gods & Heralds/The Ashen Pantheon\|The Ashen Pantheon]].

To protect themselves from the Gods, the beings hatched from the eggs and built shells around themselves. These shells became the surface of the planets in the universe. The planet [[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] are on, at the centre of it is a being, [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/The Golden Being\|The Golden Being]] whose tentacles were enticed up into the pillars and then entombed. This being is known as [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]].

[[Admin/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] also seem to be able to drain the energy from Terathra which is how it is possible to keep him contained. Terathra is also responsible for powering the [[History & Events/Skyfall Ward\|Skyfall Ward]] via [[History & Events/The Ancient Pillars\|The Ancient Pillars]] before [[History & Events/The Sundering\|The Sundering]].
