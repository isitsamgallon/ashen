# History
[[The Party/The Korrigan/The Korrigan\|The Korrigan]] first made contact with it by casting [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals) on the crystal at [[Locations/Ehobel/Saleh Tower\|Saleh Tower]]. Korrigan then managed to have a full conversation with it by meditating on the tree in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]].

[[Admin/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] had a second conversation with it after [[The Party/Aidan Knight\|Aidan Knight]] was possessed by [[Gods & Heralds/Chronovorus/Chronovorus\|Chronovorus]] in [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/Ishnmel\|Ishnmel]]. One of the time distortions was on [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] making Korrigan incredibly scared for Terathra's safety. After the distortion was lifted, the party tried to communicate through the same method Korrigan did the day before. Accept this time, Korrigan, [[The Party/Mordecai Reverence\|Mordecai Reverence]] and [[The Party/Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch\|Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] shared the burden of allowing the whole party to speak. 

Terathra was feeling strange and noted that something about the crystal at the top of [[Admin/Display Tags/The Towers\|The Towers]] could be wrong. [[The Party/Dead/Chenris Tallfellow ‡\|Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] is the only person free who can teleport up the tower and see what is wrong. When he arrives, he finds 2 [[Named Characters & Beasts/Beasts & Animals/Magic Demons\|Magic Demons]] with the crystal. Chenris decides to destroy the crystal and after some hesitation, gives the energy back to Terathra. Leading to [[Locations/Ehobel/Ishnmel/The Tower of Ishnmel\|The Tower of Ishnmel]] falling. Please see [[Session Notes/Season 3 - The Worst Diplomates/Session 15\|Session 15]] for more information.

On the third conversation, Korrigan talks to Terathra alone and Terathra is overjoyed about Korrigans return. They talk in depth and discover information about [[Named Characters & Beasts/Historically Significant  Characters/Uti, The Dragon\|Uti, The Dragon]] and the [[Books, Documents & Artefacts/Artefacts/Sword of Whispers\|Sword of Whispers]].
