### Overview
**The Keeper of Dreams and Memories**. The daughter of [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]], who was created to oversee the realm of dreams. Originally, [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] attempted to manage both the waking and dreaming worlds, but the unpredictable nature of dreams made it difficult for him to maintain balance. Realising that he could not effectively govern both realms, he birthed Somnora to take charge of the sleeping world while he focused on the waking one.

Though little else is known about her, Somnora exists to ensure that the dream world remains stable, separate from the structured reality that [[Gods & Heralds/Eldros/Eldros\|Eldros]] maintains. Her creation signifies a division of responsibilities among the gods, ensuring that both realms—waking and dreaming—are properly maintained.
