### Overview
[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] is the ancient God of death and decay. Not many know of the God's existence, much like [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], but those who do say that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] must've heave existed before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] otherwise there would be no concept of death that would end [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. He is known to be worshiped by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]] s. 

It was mentioned that at some point [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was 'captured' and that is why there are solely fragments of the God left. 

### Notable Information 
- [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was first encounter by [[Other Information/Display Tags/The Party\|The Party]] in [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] when a funeral carriage made of bones and ancient looking worshipers stopped at the party and asked them to wring the bell. [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]]  ended up ringing the bell causing the coffin, the worshippers and the carriage to disintegrate and the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|Fragment Of Vaelrith]] jumped into [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] 's body. They were soon saved by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]] s until [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] gave birth to the new [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]]

| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | With a kind smile, [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]] said that if they told them that, she could come into the dome. She nodded and said their God was called ' [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] ', and he was an ancient god. [[The Party/The Korrigan\|Korrigan]] asked if they were related to [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], and the women explained that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was much older than [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. Entering the doom and sitting down, she explained that for Aetheorion, the God of life, to die, the concept of death needed to exist. [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was that concept. Kerrigan began to say they were good friends of the [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Terathra\|Terathra]], but the women didn't seem to care. |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | It turned its eyeless sockets toward [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], and in a voice that chilled bone, the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|Fragment Of Vaelrith]] whispered: "Father... Please hand me the bell."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Session Notes/Season 4 - Ignatius Beckons/Session 38\|Session 38]] | [[The Party/Halfbie\|Halfbie]], dazed and twitching, reached into their satchel with a trembling hand. Without understanding why, they placed the bell in the [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Fragment Of Vaelrith\|creature's]] waiting palm. “Thank you,” the figure said, almost politely. Then it looked up toward the sky. The wind died in an instant. Not even the leaves rustled. And just like that, it was gone, vanished into nothing. The world held its breath.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
