### Overview
[[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] is the ancient God of death and decay. Not many know of the God's existence, much like [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]], but those who do say that [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] must've heave existed before [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]] otherwise there would be no concept of death that would end [[Gods & Heralds/Aetherion/Aetherion\|Aetherion]]. He is known to be worshiped by [[Other Information/Races/Vampire\|Vampire]] s. 

It was mentioned that at some point [[Gods & Heralds/Vaelrith/Vaelrith\|Vaelrith]] was 'captured' and that is why there are solely fragments of the God left.
